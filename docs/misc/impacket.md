# ðŸŸ¦ impacket

Impacket is a collection of Python classes for working with network protocols. Impacket focuses on providing low-level programmatic access to packets and, for some protocols (e.g., SMB1-3 and MSRPC), to the protocol implementation itself. Packets can be built from scratch, as well as parsed from raw data, and the object-oriented API makes it simple to work with deep hierarchies of protocols. The library provides a set of tools as examples of what can be done in the context of this library.
