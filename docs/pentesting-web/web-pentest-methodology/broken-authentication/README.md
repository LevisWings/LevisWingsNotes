# Broken Authentication

## Username enumeration

#### Theory

Username enumeration is when an attacker is able to observe changes in the website's behavior in order to identify whether a given username is valid.

Username enumeration typically occurs either on the login page, for example, when you enter a valid username but an incorrect password, or on registration forms when you enter a username that is already taken. This greatly reduces the time and effort required to brute-force a login because the attacker is able to quickly generate a shortlist of valid usernames.

While attempting to brute-force a login page, you should pay particular attention to any differences in:

**Status codes**: During a brute-force attack, the returned HTTP status code is likely to be the same for the vast majority of guesses because most of them will be wrong. If a guess returns a different status code, this is a strong indication that the username was correct. It is best practice for websites to always return the same status code regardless of the outcome, but this practice is not always followed.

**Error messages**: Sometimes the returned error message is different depending on whether both the username AND password are incorrect or only the password was incorrect. It is best practice for websites to use identical, generic messages in both cases, but small typing errors sometimes creep in. Just one character out of place makes the two messages distinct, even in cases where the character is not visible on the rendered page.

**Response times**: If most of the requests were handled with a similar response time, any that deviate from this suggest that something different was happening behind the scenes. This is another indication that the guessed username might be correct. For example, a website might only check whether the password is correct if the username is valid. This extra step might cause a slight increase in the response time. This may be subtle, but an attacker can make this delay more obvious by entering an excessively long password that the website takes noticeably longer to handle.

#### Practice (with Burpsuite)

To enumerate users, we will try the following brute force techniques to find them:

* [ ] Set payload:

```bash
# We set a very long password to filter by response times:
POST /login

username=bob&password=testtesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttesttest
```

* [ ] On the **Payloads** tab, make sure that the **Simple list** payload type is selected and add the list of candidate usernames.
* [ ] On the **Options** tab, under **Grep - Extract**, click **Add**.In the dialog box that appears, scroll down through the answer until you find an error message about incorrectly entered data. Use the mouse to highlight the text content of the message. The other settings will be automatically adjusted. Click **OK.**

* [ ] When starting the **attack with Intruder**, we will have to enable the following columns: **Request**, **Payload**, **Status**, **Response received**, **Error**, **Timeout**, **Length** and **Grep-Extract:**

{% hint style="danger" %}
The most important fields to pay attention to are the **status code** (Status), the **error message** provided (Grep-Extract), **since it can be different by up to one character**, and the **response time** (Response received).
{% endhint %}

## Flawed brute-force protection

* [ ] **IP block bypass via successful login**: If we are being blocked by IP but the attempt counter resets when we log in correctly, we can create a wordlist where every 2 attempts, correct credentials are used and so on.
* [ ] **IP block bypass via headers**: You can use headers such as: `X-Forwarded-Host: 192.168.0.0.x`
* [ ] **Username enumeration via account lock**: If a user account is blocked every few attempts, it is because the user is valid. With Burpsuite, we can use an Intruder attack where 5 login attempts are made with a username:

![Username enumeration via account lock: Select the attack type Cluster bomb. Add a payload position to the username parameter. Add a blank payload position to the end of the request body by clicking Add ยง twice.](../../../.gitbook/assets/account\_block\_burp1.png) ![Username enumeration via account lock: On the Payloads tab, add the list of usernames to the first payload set. For the second set, select the Null payloads type and choose the option to generate 5 payloads. This will effectively cause each username to be repeated 5 times.](../../../.gitbook/assets/account\_block\_burp2.png)

* [ ] **User rate limiting**: It's sometimes also possible to bypass this defense if you can work out how to guess multiple passwords with a single request:

```json
POST /login

{
    "username":"bob",
    "password": [ "test", "123", "bob123" ]
}
```
