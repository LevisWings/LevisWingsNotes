# Web Pentest Methodology

## Web Pentest Methodology

* [ ] Start by [**identifying** the **technologies**](../web-reconnaissance/fingerprint.md#identify-technologies) used by the web server. Look for **tricks** to keep in mind during the rest of the test if you can successfully identify the tech.
  * [ ] Any **known vulnerability** of the version of the technology?
  * [ ] Using any **well known tech**? Any **useful trick** to extract more information?
  * [ ] Any **specialised scanner** to run (like wpscan)?
* [ ] ****[**Subdomains enumeration**](../web-reconnaissance/subdomains-enumeration/): Each **subdomain** represents a **new angle to attack the network.**
  * [ ] We can also perform [**fuzzing on vhosts**](../web-reconnaissance/virtual-host-fuzzing.md).
* [ ] Launch **general purposes scanners**. You never know if they are going to find something or if the are going to find some interesting information.
* [ ] Start with the [**initial checks**](../web-reconnaissance/fingerprint.md#initial-checks): **robots**, **sitemap**, **404** error and **SSL/TLS scan** (if HTTPS).
* [ ] Start **spidering** the web page: It's time to **find** all the possible **files, folders** and **parameters being used.** Also, check for **special findings**.
  * [ ] _Note that anytime a new directory is discovered during brute-forcing or spidering, it should be spidered._
* [ ] ****[**Directory Brute-Forcing**](../web-reconnaissance/fuzzing.md#essentials): Try to brute force all the discovered folders searching for new **files** and **directories**.
  * [ ] _Note that anytime a new directory is discovered during brute-forcing or spidering, it should be Brute-Forced._
  * [ ] If there is a similar file name format (e.g., all file names start with a capital letter), then you should take this into account when fuzzing. More info: [File or directory name format](../web-reconnaissance/fuzzing.md#file-or-directory-name-format).
* [ ] [**Backups checking**](../web-reconnaissance/fuzzing.md#backups-checking): Test if you can find **backups** of **discovered files** appending common backup extensions.&#x20;
* [ ] ****[**Brute-Force parameters**](../web-reconnaissance/fuzzing.md#parameters-or-data-get-post): Try to **find hidden parameters**.
* [ ] Once you have **identified** all the possible **endpoints** accepting **user input**, check for all kind of **vulnerabilities** related to it.
