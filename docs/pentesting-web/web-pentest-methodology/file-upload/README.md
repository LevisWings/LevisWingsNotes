# File Upload

### Different scenarios

* Remote execution of commands by filename: Some applications may be displaying the contents of the uploaded file. This can be achieved with plugins or different web functionalities but sometimes it is done at the system level, i.e. a common command is executed to display the file content, such as `cat` on Linux or `type` on Windows.
* In rare cases, the back-end may be using `exiftool` to extract metadata. For example, [version 12.23 is vulnerable](https://blog.convisoappsec.com/en/a-case-study-on-cve-2021-22204-exiftool-rce/).
