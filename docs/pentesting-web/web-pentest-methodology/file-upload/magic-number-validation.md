# Magic Number Validation

Magic numbers are the most accurate way to determine the contents of a file, although they are by no means impossible to forge. A file's "magic number" is a string of bytes at the beginning of the file's contents that identifies the contents. For example, a PNG file would have these bytes at the beginning of the file: `89 50 4E 47 0D 0A 1A 0A`.

Unlike Windows, Unix systems use magic numbers to identify files; however, when it comes to uploading files, it is possible to check the magic number of the uploaded file to make sure it is safe to accept. This is by no means a guaranteed solution, but it is more effective than checking the extension of a file.
