# HTML source code (tips)

### Leak info

We can search the HTML source code for some interesting tags that may contain filtered or interesting information:

```
href,http,user,pass,hidden,<SUBDOMAIN>
```

{% hint style="danger" %}
Check also comments in the main and secondary pages. (`<!--`, `#`)
{% endhint %}

### Bypass `pattern` attribute

If there is an entry to enter some text but we are limited by the "pattern" attribute, we can remove it with the Element Inspector of any browser. In this way, we could bypass that protection found in the frontend.
