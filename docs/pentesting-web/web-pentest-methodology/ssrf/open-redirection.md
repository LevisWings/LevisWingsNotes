# Open redirection

If the above evasions do not work, there is one more trick up the attacker's sleeve, the open redirect. An open redirect is an endpoint on the server where the website visitor is automatically redirected to another website address. Take, for example, the link `https://website.thm/link?url=https://tryhackme.com`. This endpoint was created to record the number of times visitors have clicked on this link for advertising/marketing purposes. But imagine if there was a potential SSRF vulnerability with strict rules that only allowed URLs starting with https://website.thm/. An attacker could use the above function to redirect the internal HTTP request to a domain of their choice. Example:

```bash
# Open Redirect:
GET /game/nextGame?id=2&path=<OPEN REDIRECT>

# SSRF with Open Redirect:
POST /api/games/stock
api_s=/game/nextGame?id=2%26path%3dhttp%3a//127.0.0.1/admin
```
