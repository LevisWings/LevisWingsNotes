# Google Dorking

### `site`

Tells Google to only show you results from a particular site. This will help you quickly find the most reputable source on the topic you are researching. For example, if you want to search for the syntax of Python's **print()** function, you can limit the results to the official Python documentation with this search:

```bash
print site:python.org
```

### `inurl`

Searches for pages with a URL that matches the search string. This is a very powerful way to search for vulnerable pages on a particular web site. Suppose you have read a blog post about how the existence of a page named `/course/jumpto.php` on a website could indicate that it is vulnerable to remote code execution. You can check if the vulnerability exists in your target by searching for:

```bash
inurl:"/curso/jumpto.php" site:example.com
```

### `intitle`

Searches for specific strings in the title of a page. This is useful because it allows you to find pages containing a particular type of content. For example, file listing pages on web servers often have the index of in their titles. You can use this query to find directory pages on a web site:

```bash
intitle: "index of" site:example.com
```

### `link`

Searches for web pages that contain links to a specified URL. You can use it to find documentation on obscure technologies or vulnerabilities. For example, let's say you are researching the rare regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) vulnerability. You can easily find its definition online, but you might have difficulty finding examples. The link operator can discover pages that reference the vulnerability's Wikipedia page to locate discussions on the same topic:

```bash
link:"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReDoS"
```

### `filetype`

Searches for pages with a specific file extension. This is an incredible hacking tool; hackers often use it to locate files on their target sites that may be sensitive, such as log and password files. For example, this query looks for log files, which often have the file extension .log, on the target site:

```bash
filetype:log site:example.com
```

### wildcard (`*`)

You can use the wildcard operator (\*) within searches to refer to any character or series of characters. For example, the following query will return any string starting with **how to hack** and ending with **using Google**. This query will match strings such as **how to hack websites using Google**, **how to hack applications using Google**, and so on:

```
how to hack * using Google
```

### Quores (`" "`)

Adding quotes to search terms will force an exact match:

```bash
# For example, this query will search for pages containing the phrase how to hack:
"how to hack"
# And this query will search for pages containing the terms how, to, and hack, though not necessarily together:
how to hack
```

### Or (`|`)

The **or** operator is indicated by the pipe character (`|`) and can be used to search for one search term or the other, or both at the same time. The pipe character must be surrounded by spaces.

```bash
# For example, this query will search for how to hack on Reddit or Stack Overflow:
"how to hack" site:(reddit.com | stackoverflow.com)
# And this query will search for web pages that mention SQL Injection or SQLi:
(SQL Injection | SQLi)
```

### Minus (`-`)

The minus operator (**-**) excludes certain search results. For example, let's say you are interested in finding web sites that talk about hacking but not those that talk about PHP hacking. This query will search for pages that contain how to hack websites, but not php:

### Combination

You can use the advanced search engine options in many more ways to make your work more efficient. You can even search for the term Google to discover more. These operators can be more useful than you expect. For example, search for all subdomains of a company by searching as follows:

```
site:*.example.com
```

You can also search for special endpoints that may lead to vulnerabilities. Kibana is a data visualization tool that displays server performance data such as server logs, debug messages and server status. A compromised Kibana instance can allow attackers to gather extensive information about the operation of a site. of a site. Many Kibana dashboards run under the `app/kibana` path, so this will reveal whether the target has a Kibana control panel. You can then try to access the dashboard to see if it is unprotected:

```
site:example.com inurl:app/kibana
```

Google may find company resources hosted by a third party online, such as Amazon S3 buckets (we'll discuss these in more detail in "ThirdParty Hosting" on page 74):

```
site:s3.amazonaws.com COMPANY_NAME
```

Look for special extensions that may indicate a sensitive file. In addition to .log, which usually indicates log files, look for .php, cfm, asp, .jsp and .pl, the extensions commonly used for script files:

```
site:example.com ext:php
site:example.com ext:log
```

Finally, you can also combine search terms to get a more precise search. For example, this query searches the [example.com](http://example.com) site for text files containing passwords:

```
site:example.com ext:txt password
```
