Before understanding the certificate transparency, we would first need to understand the basic terminology related to digital certificates.

### What is a digital certificate?

A digital certificate is a certificate that is issued by the trusted third party which is called a **certificate authority** (**CA**) to verify the identity of the certificate sender or holder.

For example: The driving license assigned by the government authority which is a third party whom we trust. The traffic police check if the ride can or cannot ride by checking the driving license. Here in this example traffic police are like users who access the website and government authority is the certificate authority whereas the rider is the website.

### Who are certificate authorities?

**Certificate authorities** (**CA**) are the globally trusted third-party companies like VeriSign, GeoTrust, GoDaddy, etc that manage three major tasks:

* Issues certificates
* Confirm the identity of the certificate owner
* Provide proof that the certificate is valid

### What is a digital signature?

A digital signature is a mathematical way for verifying the authenticity of digital messages or documents.

The steps followed in creating a digital signature are:

1. The website holder generates the "public key" and "private key".
2. The website holder sends the “public key” with some other information like holder name, subject, serial number, signature algorithm, signature, etc to the certificate authority (CA).
3. The certificate authority (CA) verifies the data provided by the Website holder then builds the certificate and finally digitally signs it for the holder. A certificate is a document that contains necessary information about the website holder like the holder public key, expiration date, name of the certificate holder, the digital signature of the certificate-issuing authority.
4. CA send the certificate to the website holder. The holder configures the certificate in the server.

### How CA digitally sign the certificate?

### How the certificate works when a user accesses a website?

### What is Certificate Transparency?

**Certificate Transparency** (**CT**) is a project under which a Certificate Authority (CA) has to publish every SSL/TLS certificate they issue to a public log.

So, we know that certificate transparency records all entries of issued certificates in an inventory, which includes domain names, subdomain names and email addresses. This is publicly available to everyone. Using CT (Certificate Transparency) records an adversary can gather basic information about the organization's infrastructure passively.
