# ASNs

An **Autonomous System Number** (**ASN**) is a unique number assigned to an autonomous system (AS) by the **Internet Assigned Numbers Authority** (**IANA**). An AS is made up of blocks of IP addresses that have a defined policy for access to external networks and are managed by a single organization, although they can be made up of several operators.

It is interesting to find out if the company has an ASN assigned to it in order to find its IP ranges. It will be interesting to perform a vulnerability test against all the hosts within the scope and look for the domains within these IPs.

You can search by company name, by IP or by domain in:

{% embed url="https://bgp.he.net" %}
[https://bgp.he.net/](https://bgp.he.net)
{% endembed %}

You can also find the IP ranges of an organization using [http://asnlookup.com/](http://asnlookup.com) (it has a free API). You can find the IP and ASN of a domain using [http://ipv4info.com/](http://ipv4info.com).

For discovering more seed domains we want to scan the whole ASN with a port scanner and return any root domains we see in SSL certificates, etc. We can do this with Amass:

```
amass intel --asn <AS>,<AS>
```
