# Assembly

Assembly language is a low-level language that can write direct instructions that processors can understand. This was created because humans cannot interact with processors without consulting the manuals to know which hexadecimal code executes which instruction. Assembly language, despite being low-level, is much more intuitive and easier to remember than machine code (hexadecimal or shellcode) or binary machine code.

{% hint style="info" %}
The shellcode (or machine code) is a hexadecimal representation of bytes of machine code. It can be translated into assembler and can also be loaded directly into memory as binary instructions.
{% endhint %}

Binary machine code is executed by a CPU because the latter uses different electrical charges for a 1 and a 0, and can therefore calculate these instructions from the binary data once it receives them.
