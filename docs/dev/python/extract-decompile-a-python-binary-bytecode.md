# Extract/decompile a Python binary/bytecode

If we ever come across a Windows executable file generated by PyInstaller, we can extract with [pyinstxtractor](extract-decompile-a-python-binary-bytecode.md#pyinstxtractor) the **pyz files** (usually **.pyc** files), and then with tools like [uncompyle6](extract-decompile-a-python-binary-bytecode.md#uncompyle6) or [decompyle3](extract-decompile-a-python-binary-bytecode.md#decompyle3), we can decompile each file to see its Python source code.

### **pyinstxtractor**

PyInstaller Extractor is a Python script to extract the contents of a PyInstaller generated Windows executable file. The contents of the pyz file (usually pyc files) present inside the executable are also extracted.

{% hint style="success" %}
The script can run on both **Python 2.x** and **3.x**.

### uncompyle6

A native Python cross-version decompiler and fragment decompiler. The successor to decompyle, uncompyle, and uncompyle2.

{% hint style="danger" %}
**uncompyle6** translates Python bytecode back into equivalent Python source code. It accepts bytecodes from **Python version 1.0 to version 3.8.**
{% endhint %}

```bash
# Install:
sudo pip3 install uncompyle6
# Use:
umcompyle6 <PYC FILE>
```

### decompyle3

A native Python cross-version decompiler and fragment decompiler. A reworking of [uncompyle6](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/uncompyle6).

{% hint style="success" %}
**decompyle3** translates Python bytecode back into equivalent Python source code. It accepts bytecodes **from Python version 3.7 on**.
{% endhint %}

```bash
# Install:
sudo pip3 install decompyle3
# Use:
decompyle3 <PYC FILE>
```
