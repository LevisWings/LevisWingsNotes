# Exploiting exported Activities

## Authorisation bypass

When an activity is exported you can invoke its screen (UI) from an external application. Therefore, if an activity with **sensitive information** is **exported** you could **skip/bypass** the **authentication** mechanisms to access it.

You can also start an exported activity from `adb`:

{% hint style="danger" %}
Note that an authorization bypass is not always a vulnerability, it would depend on how the bypass works and what information is exposed.
{% endhint %}

```bash
abd shell
am start b3nac.injuredandroid/.b25lActivity # Add the slash /

# We can also do this if we have the PackageName and ActiviyName
## PackageName -> com.example.demo
## ActivityName exportado -> com.example.test.MainActivity
adb shell am start -n com.example.demo/com.example.test.MainActivity
```

### Sensitive information leakage

Activities can also return results. If you manage to find an unprotected exported activity that calls the setResult method and returns sensitive information, there is a leak of sensitive information.
