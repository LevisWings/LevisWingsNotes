# Search Exploits

## Browser

Always search in "google" or others:

```
<SERVICE_NAME> [version] exploit
<SERVICE_NAME> [version] cve
```

If you have already identified the CVE but cannot find an exploit or PoC, you can search for it in many ways:

```
<CVE> exploit
<CVE> github
<CVE> exploit github
```

## GitHub

GitHub can provide functional exploits created by the community. If you are looking for one of these for a CVE, it is recommended to use the GitHub search engine:

![Search all of GitHub](../../.gitbook/assets/random\_cve1.png)

If we know the CVE vulnerability but do not find functional exploits, let's try to add those vulnerabilities. Imagine the following scenario:

* A software the vulnerable to SQL injection (CVE-XXXX-XXXXX), which can allow 2 things: dump the database and impersonate a user (for example, an administrator).
* When we searched in Google, we only found functional exploits to dump the database but not to impersonate a user.
* In that case, we can use this search engine by adding keywords such as: `CVE-XXXX-XXXXX impersonate admin`, `CVE-XXXX-XXXXX admin`, `CVE-XXXX-XXXXX unauthenticated admin`, etc. Also try adding the versions or the name of the software/service.

### CVE Mitre

### Directory vendor

The vendor directory contains various third-party libraries and assets. We can search for exploits of each one by name, although it is advisable to enter these directories and find their version.
