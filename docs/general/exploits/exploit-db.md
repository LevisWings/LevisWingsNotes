```bash
searchsploit <NAME> # Search for an exploit by name.
searchsploit -x <PATH> # Command to probe or examine the code about an exploit we found.
searchsploit -m <PATH> # This command will download the exploit to your current directory.

### Tips

* Investigate the software or service first with its exact version, then with just its name. If there are several exploits, use the most critical ones (such as RCE).
* Always check if there is another similar file type. For example, if there is an exploit in C but in comment form it gives us a binary with .exe file, then we can try with that one.
* Read the comments, there may be VERY IMPORTANT requirements to take into account.
* Whenever we find an exploit, we should also look for that same exploit but on GitHub, where it can help us INFINITELY.
