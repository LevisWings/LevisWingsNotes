# Default Credentials

### Theory

Before performing password attacks, it is worth trying a couple of default passwords against the targeted service. Manufacturers set default passwords with products and equipment such as switches, firewalls, routers. There are scenarios where customers don't change the default password, which makes the system vulnerable. Thus, it is a good practice to try out admin:admin, admin:123456, etc. If we know the target device, we can look up the default passwords and try them out. For example, suppose the target server is a Tomcat, a lightweight, open-source Java application server. In that case, there are a couple of possible default passwords we can try: `admin:admin` or `tomcat:admin`.
