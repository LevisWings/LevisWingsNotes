## What is a password?

Passwords are used as an authentication method for individuals to access computer systems or applications. Using passwords ensures the owner of the account is the only one who has access. However, if the password is shared or falls into the wrong hands, unauthorized changes to a given system could occur. Unauthorized access could potentially lead to changes in the system's overall status and health or damage the file system. Passwords are typically comprised of a combination of characters such as letters, numbers, and symbols. Thus, it is up to the user how they generate passwords!

A collection of passwords is often referred to as a dictionary or wordlist. Passwords with low complexity that are easy to guess are commonly found in various publicly disclosed password data breaches. For example, an easy-to-guess password could be password, 123456, 111111, and much more. Here are the [top 100 and most common and seen passwords](https://techlabuzz.com/top-100-most-common-passwords/) for your reference. Thus, it won't take long and be too difficult for the attacker to run password attacks against the target or service to guess the password. Choosing a strong password is a good practice, making it hard to guess or crack. Strong passwords should not be common words or found in dictionaries as well as the password should be an eight characters length at least. It also should contain uppercase and lower case letters, numbers, and symbol strings (ex: \*&^%$#@).

Sometimes, companies have their own password policies and enforce users to follow guidelines when creating passwords. This helps ensure users aren't using common or weak passwords within their organization and could limit attack vectors such as brute-forcing. For example, a password length has to be eight characters and more, including characters, a couple of numbers, and at least one symbol. However, if the attacker figures out the password policy, he could generate a password list that satisfies the account password policy.

### How secure are passwords?

Passwords are a protection method for accessing online accounts or computer systems. Passwords authentication methods are used to access personal and private systems, and its main goal of using the password is to keep it safe and not share it with others.

To answer the question: How secure are passwords? depends on various factors. Passwords are usually stored within the file system or database, and keeping them safe is essential. We've seen cases where companies store passwords into plaintext documents, such as the [Sony breach](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20141204/12032329332/shocking-sony-learned-no-password-lessons-after-2011-psn-hack.shtml) in 2014. Therefore, once an attacker accesses the file system, he can easily obtain and reuse these passwords. On the other hand, others store passwords within the system using various techniques such as hashing functions or encryption algorithms to make them more secure. Even if the attacker has to access the system, it will be harder to crack.

## Password Cracking vs. Password Guessing

This section discusses password cracking terminology from a cybersecurity perspective. Also, we will discuss significant differences between password cracking and password guessing. Finally, we'll demonstrate various tools used for password cracking, including Hashcat and John the Ripper.

Password cracking is a technique used for discovering passwords from encrypted or hashed data to plaintext data. Attackers may obtain the encrypted or hashed passwords from a compromised computer or capture them from transmitting data over the network. Once passwords are obtained, the attacker can utilise password attacking techniques to crack these hashed passwords using various tools.

Password cracking is considered one of the traditional techniques in pen-testing. The primary goal is to let the attacker escalate to higher privileges and access to a computer system or network. Password guessing and password cracking are often commonly used by information security professionals. Both have different meanings and implications. Password guessing is a method of guessing passwords for online protocols and services based on dictionaries. The following are major differences between password cracking and password guessing:

* **Password guessing** is a technique used to target online protocols and services. Therefore, it's considered time-consuming and opens up the opportunity to generate logs for the failed login attempts. A password guessing attack conducted on a web-based system often requires a new request to be sent for each attempt, which can be easily detected. It may cause an account to be locked out if the system is designed and configured securely.
* **Password cracking** is a technique performed locally or on systems controlled by the attacker.
