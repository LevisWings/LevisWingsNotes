# ðŸ““ 1. Domain Controllers

## Domain Controllers

The Domain Controller, as we have said, is the **central server of a domain**, that is running the [Active Directory Domain Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/get-started/virtual-dc/active-directory-domain-services-overview) (AD DS). That means that is responsible of keeping the domain database with all the information about domain objects and offering the Active Directory services, such as authentication, authorization, name resolution, etc. Is a Windows Server machine.

The database is stored in the file `C:\Windows\NTDS\ntds.dit` of the domain controllers. Therefore if someone steals this file, she can access to all the information about the objects of the domain (computers, users, group, policies, etc), including users credentials. Therefore, the access to this file, and to the Domain Controllers should be restricted to the domain administrators.

This contrasts with the fact that **any computer in the domain must be able to talk with the Domain Controller** in order to ask for information of this database. So the Domain Controller (at least one of them) should be reachable from any part of the network.

Usually, in a domain there is more than one Domain Controller, in order to distribute the workload and prevent single point of failures. Additionally, as any other database server, Domain Controllers must be synchronized with each other to keep the data up to date.

Moreover, in order to allow computers and users to access the database data, the Domain Controllers provides a series of services like DNS, Kerberos, LDAP, SMB, RPC, etc.

### **Domain Controllers discovery**

It is clear that domains controller are one of the most important pieces of Active Directory, and due to this, they are often targeted in a pentest, so it is important to identify them, which is not very difficult.

Due to the wide range of services offered by the domain controller, there are many ways to identify the domain controllers of a domain.

One possibility that doesn't require any type of authentication is to make a simple **DNS query asking for the LDAP servers** of the domain (which are the domain controllers):

```powershell
PS C:\Users\Anakin> nslookup -q=srv _ldap._tcp.dc._msdcs.contoso.local
Server:  UnKnown
Address:  192.168.100.2

_ldap._tcp.dc._msdcs.contoso.local      SRV service location:
          priority       = 0
          weight         = 100
          port           = 389
          svr hostname   = dc01.contoso.local
_ldap._tcp.dc._msdcs.contoso.local      SRV service location:
          priority       = 0
          weight         = 100
          port           = 389
          svr hostname   = dc02.contoso.local
dc01.contoso.local      internet address = 192.168.100.2
dc02.contoso.local      internet address = 192.168.100.3
```

Also, you can use some system utility like `nltest` to get the domain controllers, but you require have an user.

```powershell
PS C:\Users\Anakin> nltest /dclist:contoso.local
Get list of DCs in domain 'contoso.local' from '\\dc01.contoso.local'.
    dc01.contoso.local [PDC]  [DS] Site: Default-First-Site-Name
    dc02.contoso.local        [DS] Site: Default-First-Site-Name
The command completed successfully
```

Moreover, if you do a port scan of a machine and the result is similar to the following, surely is a domain controller:

```
nmap 192.168.100.2 -Pn -sV -p-

Host discovery disabled (-Pn). All addresses will be marked 'up' and scan times will be slower.

This output show a lot of ports open. Here is a brief description of the service offer by each port:

* 42 -> **WINS**: Centralized service to resolve NetBIOS names to IP addresses.
* 53 -> **DNS**: Service to resolve DNS names to IP addresses.
* 88 -> **Kerberos**: Used to provide Kerberos authentication to users.
* 135 -> **RPC Endpoint Mapper**: RPC service used to find the RPC endpoints for different RPC services.
* 139 -> **NetBIOS Session Service**: An old alternative to TCP used by Windows computers. It allows to transport protocols like SMB or RPC.
* 389 -> **LDAP**: Used to query/edit the domain database.
* 445 -> **SMB**: Used to share files between computers. Also allow RPC calls through named pipes.
* 464 -> **kpasswd**: Kerberos service used to change users passwords.
* 593 -> **RPC over HTTP Endpoint Mapper**
* 636 -> **LDAPS**: LDAP with SSL
* 3268 -> **LDAP Global Catalog**: A service to query the Global Catalog.
* 3269 -> **LDAPS Global Catalog**
* 5985 -> **WinRM**: Service to manage the machine remotely with CIM objects or Powershell remoting.
* 9389 -> **ADWS**: Web service to query/edit the **domain database**.
* 49152-65535 **RPC Endpoints**: Random RPC ports where different RPC services/interfaces listen to clients.

Depending on the DC configuration you can also find the port 3389 open, which allows **RDP** connections or [many other services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-US/troubleshoot/windows-server/networking/service-overview-and-network-port-requirements)**.**&#x20;

### **Domain database dumping**

Finally, in case you become the administrator of the domain, you may want to dump the contents of the domain controller database in order to read some sensitive data such as the `krbtgt` user credentials in order to create [Golden tickets](https://en.hackndo.com/kerberos-silver-golden-tickets/).

In order to extract the contents of the database, you can log in on the domain controller and [dumping the NTDS.dit file](https://www.ired.team/offensive-security/credential-access-and-credential-dumping/ntds.dit-enumeration#no-credentials-ntdsutil) locally with [ntdsutil](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-r2-and-2012/cc753343\(v=ws.11\)) or [vssadmin](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/vssadmin), or you could perform a remote [dcsync attack](https://adsecurity.org/?p=1729), with the [mimikatz lsadump::dsync](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz/wiki/module-\~-lsadump#dcsync) command or the [impacket secretsdump.py](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/secretsdump.py) script.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Be careful launching a DCSync attack, since if you request all the credentials in a big domain, the DC that is responding could run out of memory and crash!!
