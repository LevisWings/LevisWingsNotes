# ðŸ““ 2. Windows computers

Apart from the Domain Controllers, there are many other Windows machines in a domain, that are used both as workstation (usually Windows 10/8/7/Vista/XP) or as an applications servers (usually Windows Server editions).

## **Windows computers discovery**

You can identify the Windows machines in a domain or network by using several techniques**,** which can be found in the following resource ("**Windows Domain Computers Discovery**" section):

{% content-ref url="../../ad-enumeration-cheat-sheet.md" %}
[ad-enumeration-cheat-sheet.md](../../ad-enumeration-cheat-sheet.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

The first option, in case you domain have credentials, could be to [query the domain database](https://zer1t0.gitlab.io/posts/attacking\_ad/#how-to-query-the-database) through [LDAP](https://zer1t0.gitlab.io/posts/attacking\_ad/#ldap), that can give you both the computer names and even the operating system.

```bash
ldapsearch -H ldap://192.168.100.2 -x -LLL -W -D "anakin@contoso.local" -b "dc=contoso,dc=local" "(objectclass=computer)" "DNSHostName" "OperatingSystem"
Enter LDAP Password: 
dn: CN=DC01,OU=Domain Controllers,DC=contoso,DC=local
operatingSystem: Windows Server 2019 Standard Evaluation
dNSHostName: dc01.contoso.local

dn: CN=WS01-10,CN=Computers,DC=contoso,DC=local
operatingSystem: Windows 10 Enterprise
dNSHostName: ws01-10.contoso.local

dn: CN=WS02-7,CN=Computers,DC=contoso,DC=local
operatingSystem: Windows 7 Professional
dNSHostName: WS02-7.contoso.local

dn: CN=SRV01,CN=Computers,DC=contoso,DC=local
operatingSystem: Windows Server 2019 Standard Evaluation
dNSHostName: srv01.contoso.local
```

Another techniques, in case you don't have credentials, can involve scans of the network. Windows computers have several ports open by default and they are not usually protected by a firewall in a domain environment.

For example, the [NetBIOS name service](https://zer1t0.gitlab.io/posts/attacking\_ad/#netbios-name-service) listens in the port 137 and allows you to even resolve the NetBIOS name from the IP. You can perform a NetBIOS scan by using a tool like [nbtscan](http://www.unixwiz.net/tools/nbtscan.html) or nmap [nbtstat](https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/nbstat.html) script.

```bash
nbtscan 192.168.100.0/24
192.168.100.2   CONTOSO\DC01                    SHARING DC
192.168.100.7   CONTOSO\WS02-7                  SHARING
192.168.100.10  CONTOSO\WS01-10                 SHARING
*timeout (normal end of scan)
```

Also, a very popular service that listens in the port 445 is [SMB](https://zer1t0.gitlab.io/posts/attacking\_ad/#smb), heavily used for Windows computers to communicate each other. You can perform an port scan to discover Windows computers and you can even take advantage of the NTLM authentication negotiation to retrieve the machine name. You can perform an scan with [ntlm-info](https://github.com/Zer1t0/ntlm-info) or nmap [smb-os-discovery](https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/smb-os-discovery.html) script.

```shell
ntlm-info smb 192.168.100.0/24

Target: 192.168.100.2
NbComputer: DC01
NbDomain: CONTOSO
DnsComputer: dc01.contoso.local
DnsDomain: contoso.local
DnsTree: contoso.local
Version: 10.0.17763
OS: Windows 10 | Windows Server 2019 | Windows Server 2016

Target: 192.168.100.7
NbComputer: WS02-7
NbDomain: CONTOSO
DnsComputer: ws02-7.contoso.local
DnsDomain: contoso.local
Version: 6.1.7601
OS: Windows 7 | Windows Server 2008 R2

Target: 192.168.100.10
NbComputer: WS01-10
NbDomain: CONTOSO
DnsComputer: ws01-10.contoso.local
DnsDomain: contoso.local
DnsTree: contoso.local
Version: 10.0.19041
OS: Windows 10 | Windows Server 2019 | Windows Server 2016
```

Finally, you can also scan for other ports like 135 ([RCP](https://zer1t0.gitlab.io/posts/attacking\_ad/#rcp)) or 139 ([NetBIOS session service](https://zer1t0.gitlab.io/posts/attacking\_ad/#netbios-session-service)) with nmap.

## **Windows computers connection**

Once you discover other Windows machines, you may need to connect to them in order grab credentials or data.

Usually you will need to execute commands on the remote machine to perform your actions. There are a few options to achieve this.

### **Connecting with RPC/SMB**

The first and probably the most common one is to use **RPC** with **SMB**. This is the method used by many known tools such as [PsExec](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/psexec) and the impacket examples [psexec.py](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/psexec.py), [wmiexec.py](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/wmiexec.py) and any other \*exec.py.

These tools usually execute commands by using some RPC interface and send/receive the input/output by using SMB pipes. Normally, the tools only require the 445 port (SMB) open in order to execute commands, but some like [wmiexec.py](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/wmiexec.py) will also need the port 135 (RPC over TCP).

Additionally, it is possible for these tools to perform a Pass-The-Hash by using the NT or LM hash. The impacket tools have a parameter to use the NT or LM hash directly, whereas in order to use it with PsExec, you must [inject the NT hash in the Windows session with mimikatz](https://stealthbits.com/blog/passing-the-hash-with-mimikatz/).

INSERT LINK TO: Pass-The-Hash

This way you are using **NTLM** as authentication mechanism, which may not the best option since in Active Directory, **Kerberos** is used by default.

To use Kerberos you need to provide a Kerberos ticket to the mentioned tools. In the case of impacket, you can [set a ccache file to being used by impacket](https://gist.github.com/TarlogicSecurity/2f221924fef8c14a1d8e29f3cb5c5c4a#using-ticket-in-linux), whereas in Windows you will need to [inject the ticket in the session](https://gist.github.com/TarlogicSecurity/2f221924fef8c14a1d8e29f3cb5c5c4a#using-ticket-in-windows) by using [mimikatz](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz) or [Rubeus](https://github.com/GhostPack/Rubeus).

In order to get a Kerberos ticket to use (INSERT LINK TO: getTicket (for PTT)), you can request one by using the user password, the NT hash (Overpass-the-Hash) or the Kerberos keys (Pass-The-Key) or you can simply steal a ticket from a **Windows** or **Linux** machine and use it (Pass-The-Ticket (INSERT LINK TO: Pass-The-Ticket)).

You should take into account that Windows and Linux machines (and the tools oriented to them) use different ticket file formats so you may have problems moving Linux tickets to a Windows machine or vice versa. You can convert the tickets between the different formats by using [ticket\_converter](https://github.com/Zer1t0/ticket\_converter) or [cerbero](https://github.com/Zer1t0/cerbero#convert). (INSERT LINK TO: Convert Ticket).

{% hint style="success" %}
When using Kerberos authentication you will need to pass as target to the tools the hostname (DNS name or NetBIOS name) of the remote machine instead of its IP. This is cause Kerberos authentication uses the hostname to identify the [service](https://zer1t0.gitlab.io/posts/attacking\_ad/#services) of the remote machine and provide the right ticket to authenticate against it.
{% endhint %}

If you use the IP address you will get the following error:

```shell
psexec.py contoso.local/Anakin@192.168.100.10 -k -no-pass
Impacket v0.9.21 - Copyright 2020 SecureAuth Corporation

[-] Kerberos SessionError: KDC_ERR_S_PRINCIPAL_UNKNOWN(Server not found in Kerberos database)
```

### **Connecting with Powershell Remoting**

An alternative to RPC/SMB to connect to a Windows machine is Powershell Remoting, that will allow you to get a Powershell session in the remote machine. The Powershell remoting service listens in the port 5985 and is enabled by default in the Windows Server machines.

You can use Powershell Remoting from Windows by using many [CmdLets and parameters](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/learn/ps101/08-powershell-remoting?view=powershell-7.1) available in Powershell. From a Linux machine you can use [evil-winrm](https://github.com/Hackplayers/evil-winrm).

As well as in the RPC/SMB case, you can use a password, a NT hash or a Kerberos ticket to connect to the target machine. With evil-winrm, you can pass them to the application as a parameters or configure the ccache file as in impacket. In case of the Powershell cmdlets, you can use a password directly, but if you have a Kerberos ticket or a NT hash, you will need to inject them by using [Rubeus](https://github.com/GhostPack/Rubeus) or [mimikatz](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz).

### **Connecting with RDP**

A common method for connecting to a remote machine on Windows is RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol). You can use RDP from a Windows machine using the default "Remote Desktop Connection" client ([mstsc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/mstsc)). From Linux there are excellent clients such as [rdesktop](http://www.rdesktop.org), [freerdp](https://www.freerdp.com) or [remmina](https://remmina.org).

Unlike RPC/SMB and Powershell Remoting, RDP transmits the user's simple password to the target computer to store the credentials and facilitate SSO (Single Sign On), as if the user were logged in on his physical machine. Because of this, using RDP requires using the user's password and it is not possible to perform a Pass-The-Hash... by default.

As mentioned above, when connecting via RDP the credentials are cached on the target machine, susceptible to being stolen from the lsass process with tools such as mimikatz.

Often, during a penetration test, you may want to access software installed on a user's system that is only available through a graphical user interface (GUI). This may be a password manager that can be easily exported through the GUI, or other software that can perform actions that would be impossible/unwieldy to use otherwise. You may want to pass an NT hash of a user that could not be cracked and take their session, but as we said, by default you cannot.

However, there is a way to perform Pass-The-Hash, and that is that this is only possible when the system has [Restricted Admin mode for RDP](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/blogs/kfalde/restricted-admin-mode-for-rdp-in-windows-8-1-2012-r2) enabled, introduced in Windows 8.1/2012 R2. If this is not enabled and you try to do PTH, you will get an error stating that "Account restrictions are preventing this user from logging in." (Account restrictions are preventing this user from logging in.). When Restricted Admin mode is enabled, simple credentials are not sent, so it is possible to perform a Pass-The-Hash/Key/Ticket to establish an RDP connection. Restricted Admin mode is disabled by default. The good news is that, if you have some level of administrator access to the system and access to SMB/WinRM/etc, you can enable this feature remotely.

```bash
crackmapexec smb <IP> -u <USERNAME> -H <HASH> -x 'reg add HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa /t REG_DWORD /v DisableRestrictedAdmin /d 0x0 /f'
```

Once the registry key is set or you know previously that it is already set, you can [pass the hash with xfreerdp](https://www.kali.org/blog/passing-hash-remote-desktop/) (you need to install the `freerdp2-x11` `freerdp2-shadow-x11` packages instead of `freerdp-x11` as the article said) where you only have to provide the NT has instead of the password:

```bash
# Remember that the "Restricted Admin mode for RDP" must be enabled, a feature added as of Windows 2012 R2 and Windows 8.1:
xfreerdp /u:<USERNAME>@<DOMAIN> /pth:<HASH_NTLM> /v:<IP>
```

On the other hand, from Windows you can [inject an NT hash or Kerberos ticket with mimikatz or Rubeus and then use](https://shellz.club/pass-the-hash-with-rdp-in-2019/) `mstsc.exe /restrictedadmin` to establish an RDP connection without requiring the user's password.

![Restricted Admin is not enabled](../../../.gitbook/assets/rdp\_no\_restrictedadmin.png)

## **Windows computers credentials**

### **LSASS credentials**

In a Windows machine, a common place to find credentials is the LSASS (Local Security Authority Subsystem Service) process (`lsass.exe`). The LSASS process is on charge of manage the security related operations of the computer, including users authentication.

When an user performs an [interactive logon](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/security/windows-authentication/windows-logon-scenarios#BKMK\_InteractiveLogon) in the computer, by accessing physically to the computer or through [RDP](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-R2-and-2012/dn579255\(v=ws.11\)?redirectedfrom=MSDN#remote-desktop-users), the user credentials get cached in the LSASS process in order to use SSO (Single Sign-On) when [network logon](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/security/windows-authentication/windows-logon-scenarios#BKMK\_NetworkLogon) will be required to access to other domain computers.

{% hint style="info" %}
Be aware that users authenticated through NTLM or Kerberos will not let cached credentials in the computer (except if Kerberos delegation is enabled).
{% endhint %}

The credentials are cached by some of the **SSPs** (Security Support Providers) that are used by LSASS in order to provide different authentication methods. Some SSPs are the following:

* The **Kerberos SSP** manages the Kerberos authentication and is responsible to store the tickets and Kerberos keys for the current logged users.
* The **NTLMSSP** or MSV SSP handles the NTLM authentication and is responsible for storing the NTLM hashes for the current logged users.
* The **Digest SSP** implements the Digest Access protocol, used by HTTP applications. This is the SSP that stores the cleartext user password in order to calculate the digest.&#x20;

{% hint style="danger" %}
Even if the password caching is disabled by default since Windows 2008 R2, it is still possible to enable the password caching by setting the `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\WDigest\UseLogonCredential` registry entry to 1 or [patching the Digest SSP](https://blog.xpnsec.com/exploring-mimikatz-part-1/) directly in memory.
{% endhint %}

Therefore, if we are able to access to the LSASS process memory, for which the **SeDebugPrivilege is required** (usually hold by administrators) since lsass is system process, we can retrieve the cached credentials (INSERT LINK TO: LSASS Memory). As we have seen, these cached credentials include the **NT hash** of the user, the **Kerberos keys** and tickets, and even the user password in plaintext in some old or misconfigured machines.

The common way to extract the credentials from LSASS process is by using [mimikatz](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz). We can launch mimikatz directly in the target machine, or [dumping the LSASS memory](https://www.deepinstinct.com/2021/01/24/lsass-memory-dumps-are-stealthier-than-ever-before/) with some tool like [procdump](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procdump), [comsvcs.dll](https://lolbas-project.github.io/lolbas/Libraries/Comsvcs/) or [werfault.exe](https://www.deepinstinct.com/2021/02/16/lsass-memory-dumps-are-stealthier-than-ever-before-part-2/) and then process the generated memory dump with mimikatz or [pypikatz](https://github.com/skelsec/pypykatz). It is possible also to use [lsassy](https://github.com/Hackndo/lsassy) to read a dump remotely avoiding to have to download the entire memory dump, that can take several megabytes.

To extract credentials with mimikatz, there are a few commands you should know. They will retry different secrets from the logged users:

* `sekurlsa::logonpasswords`: Extracts the NT hashes and passwords.
* `sekurlsa::ekeys`: Gets the Kerberos keys.
* `sekurlsa::tickets`: Retrieves the Kerberos tickets stored in the machine.

Specifically, in order to access to LSASS process memory, you need the [SeDebugPrivilege](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20080314-00/?p=23113), that allows the user to debug processes of other users. Usually only the administrators have this privilege (but if another user gets this privilege she can become administrator).

Moreover, **SeDebugPrivilege must be enabled** in the process that tries to dump the LSASS memory. By default is enabled in Powershell and disabled in CMD (and therefore in their child processes). If you are launching mimikatz, you can enable it by using the `privilege::debug` command. In other case you can launch the process with Powershell using `powershell.exe <command>`, or using some tool like [sepriv](https://github.com/Zer1t0/sepriv) to enable it in CMD.

Notwithstanding, you should be aware that LSASS can be protected against credential extraction.This could be achieved by [Credential Guard](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/credential-guard/credential-guard-how-it-works), that uses the hypervisor technology to store the credentials in a safer place outside of the operative system. However [Credential Guard can be bypassed](https://teamhydra.blog/2020/08/25/bypassing-credential-guard/).

LINK TO: Protection credentials

Additionally, lsass.exe can be configured to run as a PPL (Protected Process Light). Even if this makes more difficult the credentials extraction, it [can be disabled](https://www.redcursor.com.au/blog/bypassing-lsa-protection-aka-protected-process-light-without-mimikatz-on-windows-10).

### Registry credentials

#### **LSA secrets**

Other location to find credentials is the registry. In the registry the computer stores some credentials required in order to work properly. One of the places where sensible credentials are stored is in the [LSA secrets](https://passcape.com/index.php?section=docsys\&cmd=details\&id=23).

The LSA secrets is an special storage located in the registry which is used to save sensible data that is only accessible for the `SYSTEM` local account. In the disk, the LSA secrets are saved in the SECURITY [hive](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/sysinfo/registry-hives) file, that is encrypted with the BootKey/SysKey (stored in the SYSTEM hive file).

```powershell
# LSA Secrets keys:
PS C:\> whoami
nt authority\system
PS C:\> reg query HKLM\SECURITY\Policy\Secrets

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SECURITY\Policy\Secrets
    (Default)    REG_NONE

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SECURITY\Policy\Secrets\$MACHINE.ACC
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SECURITY\Policy\Secrets\DefaultPassword
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SECURITY\Policy\Secrets\DPAPI_SYSTEM
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SECURITY\Policy\Secrets\NL$KM
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SECURITY\Policy\Secrets\_SC_mysql
```

In the LSA secrets you can find:

* **Domain Computer Account:** In order to work as part of the domain, the computer needs an user account in the domain. Therefore, the username and password of this computer account needs to be available to the operating system, so they are stored in the LSA secrets. Also, you have to know that the computer password is [changed every 30 days by default](https://adsecurity.org/?p=280). This computer account is used by the `SYSTEM` local account to interact with the domain, but not locally, thus, this account has no administrative privileges in the machine. However, even if the computer domain account has no administrative privileges, you can use it to create a **Silver ticket** or perform a **RBCD attack** to get access to the machine as an administrator.
* **Service users passwords:** In order to run services on behalf of an user, the computer needs to store its password. However, the user of the password is not stored, but the service name, so you may need to investigate what is the username.
* **Auto-logon password:** If windows [auto-logon is enabled](https://keithga.wordpress.com/2013/12/19/sysinternals-autologon-and-securely-encrypting-passwords/), the password can be stored in the LSA secrets. The other alternative is that it is saved in `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon` registry key under the key `DefaulUserName`. The domain and username are always stored in `DefaultDomainName` and `DefaultUserName`, respectively.
* **DPAPI master keys:** The [data protection API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/security/how-to-use-data-protection) (DPAPI) is used to allow users encrypt sensible data without need to worry about cryptographic keys. If you are able to retrieve the master keys, then you [can decrypt users data](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/windows/windows-local-privilege-escalation/dpapi-extracting-passwords).

Moreover, in the SECURITY hive file, there are also stored the credentials from the last [domain users logged in the machine](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/user-profiles-and-logon/cached-domain-logon-information), known as the Domain cached credentials (DCC). Thus, the computer can authenticate the domain user even if the connection with the domain controllers is lost. This cached credentials are MSCACHEV2/MSCASH hashes, different from the NT hashes, so they cannot be used to perform a Pass-The-Hash, but you can still try to [crack them](https://www.ired.team/offensive-security/credential-access-and-credential-dumping/dumping-and-cracking-mscash-cached-domain-credentials) in order to retrieve the user password.

#### **SAM**

And the other place where there are credentials is the [SAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security\_Account\_Manager) hive file, that contains the NT hashes of the local users of the computer. This could be useful since sometimes organizations set the same local Administrator password in the domain computers.

#### **Dumping registry credentials**

To get the credentials from the SECURITY and SAM hives, you can read them from memory by using mimikatz.

First you will need to execute `token::elevate` to acquire a `SYSTEM` session, that allows you to read the credentials. Also execute `privilege::debug` if required to enable the SeDebugPrivilege.

Then, you can execute the following commands that will retrieve the different credentials:

* `lsadump::secrets`: Get the LSA secrets.
* `lsadump::cache`: Retrieve the cached domain logons.
* `lsadump::sam`: Fetch the local account credentials.

An alternative is to save a copy of the hive files with [reg save](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/reg-save) command, move them to our machine, and finally to get the content with [impacket secretsdump](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/secretsdump.py) script or mimikatz.

The process to exfiltrate the hives and dump their contents can be found in the following resource:

{% content-ref url="../../../general/credential-access/os-credential-dumping/sam-and-lsa-secrets-and-cached-domain-credentials.md" %}
[sam-and-lsa-secrets-and-cached-domain-credentials.md](../../../general/credential-access/os-credential-dumping/sam-and-lsa-secrets-and-cached-domain-credentials.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Example:

```bash
$ secretsdump.py -system system.bin -security security.bin -sam sam.bin  LOCAL

* The `Dumping cached domain logon information` section contains the Domain Cached Credentials. In order to [crack them](https://www.ired.team/offensive-security/credential-access-and-credential-dumping/dumping-and-cracking-mscash-cached-domain-credentials), you need to saved them in format `$DCC2$10240#username#hash`, then you can use [hashcat](https://hashcat.net).
* The section `$MACHINE.ACC` contains the computer account password (encoded in hexadecimal), as well the NT hash. It can be useful for the Zerologon attack:

INSERT LINK TO: Zerologon attack

* The section `DefaultPassword` contains the Auto-logon password. In order to get the domain and username, you need to check the `DefaultDomainName` and `DefaultUserName` entries of the `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon` registry key.
* The `DPAPI_SYSTEM` section contains the master DPAPI keys of the system. These keys allow to [decrypt the user files](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/windows/windows-local-privilege-escalation/dpapi-extracting-passwords).
* The `NK$LM` give us the [key used to encrypt the Domain Cached Credentials](https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/blogs/spiderlabs-blog/dumping-lsa-secrets-on-nt5-x64/), but since secretsdump already decrypt them is only for informational purposes.
* Finally, the entries with format `_SC_<service>` are the ones that indicates the password of users that are running services. In this case, the `mysql` service. We don't know the username of the service user, but we can check it in the computer.

```powershell
PS C:\> Get-WmiObject win32_service -Filter "name='mysql'" | select -ExpandProperty startname
CONTOSO\han
```

### **Powershell history**

Apart from the LSASS process and registry, you can also search for credentials in other places like the Powershell history of users. You can use the following commands to locate and read the Powershell history.

```powershell
(Get-PSReadlineOption).HistorySavePath # Get the Powershell history path of the current users.
gc (Get-PSReadLineOption).HistorySavePath # Read current history file
type C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\PSReadLine\ConsoleHost_history.txt # Read current history file
Get-ChildItem C:\Users\*\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\PSReadLine\ConsoleHost_history.txt # Check the Powershell history of all users
```

Also, as a tip, you may want to use the following command to avoid storing your own commands in the Powershell history.

```powershell
Set-PSReadlineOption -HistorySaveStyle SaveNothing
```

### **Other places to find credentials in Windows**

Moreover, you can also search for credentials in scripts or configuration files located in the computer. There are also a lot of software like browsers that stores credentials that could be useful in a pentest, to check a good list of software that stores its credentials you can check the [LaZagne project](https://github.com/AlessandroZ/LaZagne).

Alternatively, in a pentest or red team engagement, you could also use another techniques to get credentials like set [keyloggers](https://www.tarlogic.com/en/blog/how-to-create-keylogger-in-powershell/) or fake [SSP modules](https://adsecurity.org/?p=1760).
