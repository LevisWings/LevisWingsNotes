# ðŸ““ 3. Linux computers

## Linux computers discovery

In order to discovery Linux computers in a domain you can also [query to the domain database just like with the Windows computers](https://app.gitbook.com/s/zQRvNu0fMpYTCdynSCbo/c/dR0syOmskfGKGjDA96kA/active-directory/ad-enumeration-cheat-sheet#windows-domain-computers-discovery) by using LDAP in case you have domain credentials.

In other case, can be a little more difficult since Linux computers don't have any characteristic port opened by default, however many Linux machines are used as servers that are remotely administrate. In order to administrate Linux computers, usually the **SSH** protocol is used. The SSH server service listens in the port 22 so you can perform a scan to this port in the network in order to identify Linux machines.

## **Linux computers connection**

In order to connect to a Linux machine to get a shell in it, the most common option is to use **SSH**. Sometimes you may even could use **Powershell remoting**, since it can work over SSH.

```
ssh <USERNAME>@<TARGET>
ssh -i <ID_RSA> <USERNAME>@<TARGET>
```

Finally in case the target Linux computer is part of the domain, you may [be able to use Kerberos authentication](https://www.n00py.io/2020/12/alternative-ways-to-pass-the-hash-pth/) with SSH. You can specify the SSH client to use Kerberos authentication by enabling the GSSAPI authentication (`-o GSSAPIAuthentication=yes`). You can [get a ticket](../../../general/lateral-movement/use-alternate-authentication-material/pass-the-ticket.md) by stolen it (Pass-The-Ticket), or by requesting it with a NT hash (Overpass-The-Hash) or Kerberos key (Pass-The-Key). You can use [Rubeus](https://github.com/GhostPack/Rubeus), [cerbero](https://github.com/Zer1t0/cerbero) or [impacket](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket) to request Kerberos tickets with NT hash or Kerberos keys.

Moreover, older Linux machines may have [Telnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telnet) enabled on port 23. You will need an username and password to connect to it.

## **Linux computers credentials**

Unfortunately for attackers, Linux doesn't have a lsass process with cached credentials. But there are many places that can be interesting to lookâ€¦

### **Linux Kerberos tickets**

In order to be authenticate users, the Linux machines usually have a Kerberos client that is configured with the domain computer account. You can find the credentials in the keytab, usually found in `/etc/krb5.keytab`, or in the value specified by the environment variables `KRB5_KTNAME` or `KRB5_CLIENT_KTNAME`, or specified in the [Kerberos configuration file](https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-1.12/doc/admin/conf\_files/krb5\_conf.html) in `/etc/krb5.conf`. You can display its contents, including the keys, with `klist` command, or [cerbero](https://github.com/Zer1t0/cerbero).

```bash
klist -k -Ke
Keytab name: FILE:/etc/krb5.keytab
KVNO Principal
---- --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   1 r2d2@contoso.local (DEPRECATED:arcfour-hmac)  (0xc49a77fafad6d3a9270a8568fa453003)
```

In this case there is a configured account with the NT hash (that is used in RC4-HMAC algorithm of Kerberos). You can use the keys stored to [ask for a Kerberos ticket](https://www.tarlogic.com/en/blog/how-to-attack-kerberos/) an impersonate the user.

Additionally, when a domain user is authenticated in the machine, a Kerberos ticket is retrieved. You can take these tickets and impersonate the users in the domain. You can normally find the tickets under the `/tmp` directory in files with the format `krb5cc_%{uid}` where uid is the [user UID](https://linuxhandbook.com/uid-linux/). However, it is also possible that tickets are stored in the [Linux kernel keys](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/keyrings.7.html) instead of files, but you can grab them and convert to files by using [tickey](https://github.com/TarlogicSecurity/tickey). Once you have the ticket files, you can use them to perform a Pass the ticket attack.

```bash
ls /tmp/ | grep krb5cc
krb5cc_1000
krb5cc_1569901113
krb5cc_1569901115
```

In order to be sure [where the tickets are stored](https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-1.12/doc/basic/ccache\_def.html) in a Linux machine, you can check the [Kerberos configuration file](https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-1.12/doc/admin/conf\_files/krb5\_conf.html) in `/etc/krb5.conf`.

### **Linux user files**

Apart from that, you can get the credentials stored in the `/etc/shadow` file that contains the local users passwords. Then you can try to [crack them by using hashcat](https://techglimpse.com/cracking-linux-password-hashes-with-hashcat/). Sometimes passwords are reused across machines. however you cannot perform a Pass-The-Hash attack since in order to remotely authenticate against a Linux machine, using [SSH](https://zer1t0.gitlab.io/posts/attacking\_ad/#ssh) for example, you require the password.

### **SSH keys**

Another possibility is to search for [SSH](https://zer1t0.gitlab.io/posts/attacking\_ad/#ssh) private keys, usually stored in the `.ssh` directory of the users directory. The name of the file is usually `id_rsa` or `id_ed25519`.

In case the private key doesn't require a passphrase for using it, then you may can use it to connect to another machines in the domain.

Furthermore, if you can find the `known_hosts` file in `.ssh` directory, and you are lucky, it may show you the hostnames of the machines that are connected through ssh by using the private keys. However, this file can contain the names hashed, but you can [crack them with hashcat](https://github.com/chris408/known\_hosts-hashcat). To create a wordlist of hostnames you could query the hostnames of the machines in the domain.

### **Bash history**

Additionally, you may find more information about ssh connections and other stuff like credentials in the command history of the machine users, usually located in the `.bash_history` file of the user directory.

By the way, if you want to avoid letting your commands logged in the history, you can unset the `HISTFILE` environment variable or using a [similar](https://www.if-not-true-then-false.com/2010/quit-bash-shell-without-saving-bash-history/) [method](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/disable-bash-shell-history-linux/).

```bash
# Disable bash history
unset HISTFILE
```

### **Other places to find credentials in Linux**

Likewise, you may be able to find passwords and keys to connect to different services (like databases) and machines in configuration files of the software or scripts located in the machine.

Moreover, you can check the [LaZagne project](https://github.com/AlessandroZ/LaZagne) for more software that can be susceptible of credential stealing.
