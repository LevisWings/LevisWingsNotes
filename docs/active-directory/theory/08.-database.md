# ðŸ““ 08. Database

## Introduction

We have been talking about the domain database and some objects that are stored in it, such as users, groups or services. Let's see now more details about the database.

Firstly, the physical location of the database is the `C:\Windows\NTDS\ntds.dit` file, located in the Domain Controllers. Each Domain Controller has its own NTDS file and synchronization between Domain Controllers is required in order to keep the database up to date.

## Classes <a href="#classes" id="classes"></a>

But let's talk about the database structure. The Active Directory database has an [schema](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2003/cc773309\(v=ws.10\)) that defines different [object classes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/adschema/classes). Each class have different properties and serves for different purposes. For example, there is the [User class](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/adschema/c-user), the [Computer class](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/adschema/c-computer) or the [Group class](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/adschema/c-group).

Moreover, a class can be the subclass of a parent class, that allows to inherit properties. For example, the Computer class is a subclass of User class, therefore the computer objects can have the same properties of the user objects ,like `SAMAccountName`, and some new custom properties, like `OperatingSystem`.

All the classes are subclasses of the [Top](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/adschema/c-top) class, that defines the essential properties like `ObjectClass` or `ObjectGUID`.

The `ObjectClass` property contains a list of the classes of an object, that is its current class and all of the parent classes.

On the other hand, the `ObjectGUID` property is a [GUID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally\_unique\_identifier) (globally unique identifier) to identify each object of the database. It must not be confused with the `SID` (or `SecurityIdentifier`) property, which is an identifier related to security principals, such as users or groups.

Also is important to note that classes can be attached to auxiliary classes in order to get its properties. This auxiliary classes won't appear in the `ObjectClass` property. For example, many of the most relevant classes when performing a pentest, like User and Group, are attached to [Security-Principal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/adschema/c-securityprincipal) auxiliary class, the class that defines the `SAMAccountName` and `SID` properties.

```bash
PS C:\> . .\PowerView.ps1
PS C:\> Get-NetComputer dc01 -Properties objectclass | select -ExpandProperty objectclass
top
person
organizationalPerson
user
computer
```

## Properties <a href="#properties" id="properties"></a>

As we have seen, each class can have several properties or attributes. Usually, the properties store a string value, like `Name` or a number like `UserAccountControl`.

Generally, any user of the domain can read the information of any object of the domain, with a few exceptions. The first exception is the users passwords that cannot be retrieved.

The database defines the [UserPassword](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows\_protocols/ms-adts/f3adda9f-89e1-4340-a3f2-1f0a6249f1f8) and [UnicodePwd](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows\_protocols/ms-ada3/71e64720-be27-463f-9cc5-117f4bc849e1), but these properties cannot be read, only written. When a [password change](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-US/troubleshoot/windows/win32/change-windows-active-directory-user-password) is required, these properties can be written in order to modify the user password.

Moreover, there are certain properties that contain sensitive data that should be only retrieved by authorized users. In order to achieve this, these property are marked as [confidential properties](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/windows-security/mark-attribute-as-confidential) in the schema (setting the `128` flag in [SearchFlags](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/adschema/a-searchflags) of the property definition) . Thus, in order to read a confidential property, apart from the read rights, an user required **CONTROL\_ACCESS right** (LINK TO: ControlAccess ACE) over that specific property.

```bash
PS C:\Users\Administrator> Get-ADObject -LDAPFilter "(searchflags:1.2.840.113556.1.4.803:=128)" -SearchBase "CN=Schema,CN=Configuration,DC=contoso,DC=local" | Select Name

ms-PKI-Credential-Roaming-Tokens
ms-DS-Issuer-Certificates
ms-PKI-RoamingTimeStamp
ms-PKI-DPAPIMasterKeys
ms-PKI-AccountCredentials
UnixUserPassword
```

Additionally, there are certain properties that require to meet certain conditions before being written. This is controlled with [Validated Writes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/adschema/validated-writes), for example editing services of an account.

Furthermore, in order to manage sets of related properties, for given permissions to an user, is also possible to use [property sets](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/adschema/property-sets) instead of have to manage the properties individually.

## Principals <a href="#principals" id="principals"></a>

One term that you should be familiar with is [principal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/access-control/security-principals). In Active Directory, a **principal is a security entity**. The most common **principals are users, groups and computers**. This terminology is also used in other areas, like [Kerberos](https://zer1t0.gitlab.io/posts/attacking\_ad/#kerberos).

Security principals are any entity that can be authenticated by the operating system, such as a user account, a computer account, or a thread or process that runs in the security context of a user or computer account, or the security groups for these accounts. Security principals have long been the foundation for controlling access to protected resources on Windows computers. Each principal is represented in the operating system by a unique security identifier (SID).

### SID

In order to identify principals, each one is assigned a **SID** (Security Identifier). In Active Directory you can find three kind of SIDs.

The **Domain SID** is used to identify the domain, as well as the base for SIDs of the domain principals.

```powershell
PS C:\> $(Get-ADDomain).DomainSID.Value
S-1-5-21-1372086773-2238746523-2939299801
```

The **Principal SID** is used to identify principals. It is compose by the domain SID and a principal RID (Relative Identifier).

```powershell
PS C:\> $(Get-ADUser Anakin).SID.Value
S-1-5-21-1372086773-2238746523-2939299801-1103
```

In this example you can see that the user SID is the domain SID plus the 1103 RID.

Finally, in Active Directory there are many [Well-known SIDs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/identity/security-identifiers-in-windows) that identify abstract entities for special situations. Here are the most common ones:

* S-1-5-11 -> **Authenticated Users**. The users logged on the system belongs to this group.
* S-1-5-10 -> **Principal Self**. Used in security descriptors (INSERT LINK TO: ACLs -> Security descriptors) to reference the object itself.

```powershell
# Self SID (S-1-5-10) in user security descriptor:
PS C:\> . .\PowerView.ps1
PS C:\> $(Get-DomainObjectAcl Anakin)[41]


ObjectDN               : CN=Anakin,CN=Users,DC=contoso,DC=local
ObjectSID              : S-1-5-21-1372086773-2238746523-2939299801-1103
ActiveDirectoryRights  : WriteProperty
ObjectAceFlags         : ObjectAceTypePresent, InheritedObjectAceTypePresent
ObjectAceType          : ea1b7b93-5e48-46d5-bc6c-4df4fda78a35
InheritedObjectAceType : bf967a86-0de6-11d0-a285-00aa003049e2
BinaryLength           : 56
AceQualifier           : AccessAllowed
IsCallback             : False
OpaqueLength           : 0
AccessMask             : 32
SecurityIdentifier     : S-1-5-10
AceType                : AccessAllowedObject
AceFlags               : ContainerInherit, InheritOnly, Inherited
IsInherited            : True
InheritanceFlags       : ContainerInherit
PropagationFlags       : InheritOnly
AuditFlags             : None
```

There are also some Well-know SIDs that defines the schema for built-in principals of the domain/forest. For example:

* **Administrator** -> S-1-5-21-domain-500
* **Domain Admins** -> S-1-5-21-domain-512
* **Domain Users** -> S-1-5-21-domain-513
* **Enterprise Admins** -> S-1-5-21-root domain-519

```powershell
# Administrator SID:
PS C:\> $(Get-ADUser Administrator).SID.Value
S-1-5-21-1372086773-2238746523-2939299801-500
```

## Distinguished Names <a href="#distinguished-names" id="distinguished-names"></a>

It is also important to understand the `DistinguishedName` property. The `DistinguishedName` is like a path that indicates the object position in the database hierarchy (similar to a file path).

```powershell
# DistinguishedName of object:
PS C:\> Get-ADComputer dc01 | select -ExpandProperty DistinguishedName
CN=DC01,OU=Domain Controllers,DC=contoso,DC=local
```

It is frequently used to identify objects in the database and to reference another objects in the database. For example, the members of a group are referenced by its `DistinguishedName`.

```powershell
# List members of a group:
PS C:\> Get-ADGroup "Domain Admins" -Properties member | select -ExpandProperty Member
CN=leia,CN=Users,DC=contoso,DC=local
CN=Administrator,CN=Users,DC=contoso,DC=local
```

The [Distinguished Name](https://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=101405\&seqNum=7) (DN) is compose by several parts that can be:

### Domain Component (DC)

It usually identifies the domain parts of the database. For example, for `it.domain.com` the DC part will be `DC=it,DC=domain,DC=com`.

### [Organizational Unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active\_Directory#Organizational\_units) (OU)

Identify containers that are used to group several related objects. It is worth to note that, even if OUs are similar to groups, its purpose is different. The OUs purpose is to organize objects in the database, whereas security groups are used to organize permissions in the domain/forest.

> Sometimes, organizations maps the OUs directly to security groups in a automated way. These groups are known as [shadow groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active\_Directory#Shadow\_groups).

Organize objects in OUs is useful since you can apply the a **GPO** (INSERT LINK TO: GPO) to the OU that affect to all its objects. This is not possible for members of a group.

### Common Name (CN)

The name that identifies the object. Sometimes you will see more than one CN on a path, because some objects also acts as containers. For example, in `CN=Administrator,CN=Users,DC=contoso,DC=local`, the `CN=Users` identifies the Users container.

## Partitions <a href="#partitions" id="partitions"></a>

Apart from OUs and containers, the database is also divided by partitions. Each database has the following partitions:

* **Domain**: Stores the domain objects.
* **Configuration**: Stores configuration of the domain, such as the `HOST` service alias or `Well-known` SIDs that we have seen before.
* **Schema**: Stores the definition of the classes and properties used by the database.
* **Domain DNS Zones**: Stores the DNS records of the domain and subdomains.
* **Forest DNS Zones**: Stores the DNS records of the rest of the forest, including parent domains.

```powershell
# List database partitions:
PS C:\> Import-Module ActiveDirectory
PS C:\> cd AD:
PS AD:\> ls

Name                 ObjectClass          DistinguishedName
----                 -----------          -----------------
contoso              domainDNS            DC=contoso,DC=local
Configuration        configuration        CN=Configuration,DC=contoso,DC=local
Schema               dMD                  CN=Schema,CN=Configuration,DC=contoso,DC=local
DomainDnsZones       domainDNS            DC=DomainDnsZones,DC=contoso,DC=local
ForestDnsZones       domainDNS            DC=ForestDnsZones,DC=contoso,DC=local
```

> You need to load the ActiveDirectory Powershell module in order to access to the `AD:` drive with Powershell.

Usually you will only use the domain partition, but is important to know how the database is organized in case you require other data that is not in the domain partition.

A tool will search in the domain partition, so if you are searching objects that are in order partition, you will to specify the partition `DistinguishedName` as search base.

```powershell
# Search sites in configuration partition:
PS C:\> Get-ADObject -LDAPFilter "(objectclass=site)" -SearchBase "CN=Configuration,$((Get-ADDomain).DistinguishedName)" | select name

name
----
Default-First-Site-Name
mysite
```

For example, tools like [adidnsdump](https://github.com/dirkjanm/adidnsdump) or [dns-dump](https://github.com/mmessano/PowerShell/blob/master/dns-dump.ps1) use the DNS Zones partitions in order to retrieve all the DNS information of the domain.

## Global Catalog <a href="#global-catalog" id="global-catalog"></a>

The domain database contains all the objects of the current domain, but in order to speed searches for objects in other domains of the forest, some Domain Controllers also contains a subset of objects of other domains.

These Domains Controllers can be called [Global Catalogs](https://docs.microsoft.com/pt-pt/previous-versions/windows/server/cc737410\(v=ws.10\)#domain-controller-and-global-catalog-server-structure) and contains extra read-only partitions with objects of other domains, for which only a subset of properties are stored, usually the most used ones. For example, if you need only to consult the name of an user in other domain, then the global catalog will allow you to retrieve it without requiring to query the other domain Domain Controller.

```powershell
# List the Global Catalogs of the domain:
PS C:\> Get-ADForest |select -ExpandProperty GlobalCatalogs
dc01.poke.mon
itdc01.it.poke.mon
```

In case you want to consult the Global Catalog, you need to an specify a different port for the connection since the global catalog service listen in the port 3268 (LDAP).

```powershell
# Searching in the global catalog:
PS C:\> Get-ADUser -Server "poke.mon:3268" -Filter * | select DistinguishedName

DistinguishedName
-----------------
CN=Administrator,CN=Users,DC=poke,DC=mon
CN=Guest,CN=Users,DC=poke,DC=mon
CN=krbtgt,CN=Users,DC=poke,DC=mon
CN=CONTOSO$,CN=Users,DC=poke,DC=mon
CN=pikachu,CN=Users,DC=poke,DC=mon
CN=ITPOKEMON$,CN=Users,DC=poke,DC=mon
CN=Administrator,CN=Users,DC=it,DC=poke,DC=mon
CN=Guest,CN=Users,DC=it,DC=poke,DC=mon
CN=krbtgt,CN=Users,DC=it,DC=poke,DC=mon
CN=POKEMON$,CN=Users,DC=it,DC=poke,DC=mon
CN=porygon,CN=Users,DC=it,DC=poke,DC=mon
```

## How to query the database? <a href="#how-to-query-the-database" id="how-to-query-the-database"></a>

In order to interact with the database data, the Domain Controllers gives you several options that are translate in different protocols/services they support.

### **LDAP**

Probably, the first one that should be mentioned is [LDAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight\_Directory\_Access\_Protocol) (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) protocol. With LDAP is possible to access to the domain database as well as the Global Catalog.

```bash
# LDAP ports:
             .-------------
                      |
                    .---
           .--TCP-->| 389 LDAP
           |        '---
           |          |
           |        .---
           |--SSL-->| 636 LDAPS
 .------.  |        '---

           |--TCP-->| 3268 LDAP Global Catalog
           |        '---
           |          |
           |        .---
           '--SSL-->| 3269 LDAPS Global Catalog 
                    '---
                      |
                      '-------------
```

LDAP defines a query syntax that allows you to filter the objects that you want retrieve/edit of the database. You can filter objects based on its properties. For example, to retrieve the groups of the domain with members you can use the following query `(&(objectsclass=group)(members=*))`.

Apart from filters, LDAP also allows you to specify the properties you would like to retrieve for each object, for example the name. Be sure to check the [LDAP wiki](https://ldapwiki.com) if you need examples of retrieving information from Active Directory.

```bash
# Domain groups with members:
ldapsearch -H ldap://192.168.100.2 -x -LLL -W -D "anakin@contoso.local" -b "dc=contoso,dc=local" "(&(objectclass=group)(member=*))" "samaccountname"
Enter LDAP Password: 
dn: CN=Administrators,CN=Builtin,DC=contoso,DC=local
sAMAccountName: Administrators

dn: CN=Users,CN=Builtin,DC=contoso,DC=local
sAMAccountName: Users

dn: CN=Guests,CN=Builtin,DC=contoso,DC=local

# refldap://ForestDnsZones.contoso.local/DC=ForestDnsZones,DC=contoso,DC=local

# refldap://DomainDnsZones.contoso.local/DC=DomainDnsZones,DC=contoso,DC=local

# refldap://contoso.local/CN=Configuration,DC=contoso,DC=local
```

Almost any object and property of the Active Directory database can be retrieved by using LDAP. The exception are those attributes that are highly sensitive, such as users credentials.

LDAP is used by many Windows tools like [Powerview](https://github.com/BC-SECURITY/Empire/blob/master/data/module\_source/situational\_awareness/network/powerview.ps1) or [ADExplorer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/adexplorer). In case you don't have tools, you can always use [Powershell to query LDAP](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.directoryservices?view=net-5.0\\]\\\[.NET%20objects%20related%20to%20LDAP\\]\\]%20to%20make%20LDAP%20queries,%20youcan%20check%20DomainSearcher%20as%20example) by using .NET.

On the other hand, from Linux, you can use [ldapsearch](https://linux.die.net/man/1/ldapsearch) and [ldapmodify](https://linux.die.net/man/1/ldapmodify) tools.

When you need to retrieve information from the Active Directory, like enumerating users or something like that, LDAP should the first thing to come to your mind. But remember that LDAP also allows you to modify objects, so if you need to add an user to a group or stuff like that, well.. this is a way.

### **ADWS**

As alternative to LDAP, [in Windows Server 2008 R2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/dd391908\(v=ws.10\)?redirectedfrom=MSDN), Microsoft introduced ADWS (Active Directory Web Services), a protocol to query and manipulate domain objects based on [SOAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP) messages.

It is [compatible with LDAP filters](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows\_protocols/ms-wsds/2ded136c-2fe2-4f7d-8d09-a7118815c6bb) so it is possible to perform very specific queries and retrieve only the required properties. In fact, when ADWS is used, internally the DC perform LDAP requests to retrieve the results.

```bash
# ADWS related ports and protocols;
                              .---------------------------------------
                              |          Domain Controller
                            ,---
                            | 389 (Domain) <------------.
                            '---                        |    .------.
                              |                         |----| LDAP |
                            .---                        |    '------'
                            | 3268 (Global Catalog) <---'       |
                            '---                                ^
                              |                                 |
 .------.     .------.      .---                                |
 | ADWS |>--->| SOAP |>---->| 9389  >----------------->---------'
 '------'     '------'      '---
                              |
                              '---------------------------------------
```

ADWS is the protocol used by the [ActiveDirectory Powershell module](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/addsadministration/?view=windowsserver2019-ps).

```powershell
# List users using ADWS:
PS C:\Users\Administrator> Get-ADUser -Filter * | select name

name
----
Administrator
Guest
krbtgt
Anakin
Han
POKEMON$
leia
luke
```

### **Other protocols**

Apart from LDAP and ADWS, there are many other protocols that allow to retrieve information from the database. Although the rest of protocols, generally only work with a subset with the database.

The [DNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain\_Name\_System) protocol, used mostly to resolve the IP address of computers, also retrieves its information from the database.

The [SAMR](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows\_protocols/MS-SAMR/4df07fab-1bbc-452f-8e92-7853a3c7e380) (Security Account Manager Remote) protocol allows to query and edit basic info of the users and groups. Is the one used by commands such as `net user /domain`.

The [DRSR](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows\_protocols/ms-drsr/f977faaa-673e-4f66-b9bf-48c640241d47) (Directory Replication Service Remote) protocol is the one used by the Domain Controllers to synchronize the database. Through this protocol even the user credentials can be retrieved (if you have enough permissions) and is the one used to perform the [dcsync attack](https://adsecurity.org/?p=1729).

The [Kerberos](https://www.tarlogic.com/en/blog/how-kerberos-works/) authentication protocol also uses the database to generate the required tickets based on the requested service. Additionally, the kpasswd service (port 464) is used by Kerberos to change the user password.

The [Netlogon](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows\_protocols/ms-nrpc/ff8f970f-3e37-40f7-bd4b-af7336e4792f) protocol is used by computers in order to authenticate the domain users. For example, is used by NTLM authentication. Also, this was the protocol affected by the [Zerologon](https://www.secura.com/blog/zero-logon) vulnerability.

There are many other protocols that interacts with the database, but these short list should give you the idea of there are many different ways to access to the same data.
