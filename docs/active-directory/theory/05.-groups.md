## Groups

But the management of users can be cumbersome without groups. Imagine that you have the managers department that needs to access to highly sensitive documents. Should you give permission to each manager one by one? A lot of work, but you can handle it because only a new manager is added each year. But now the policy changes and managers should also be able to access to documents of human resources department. Should you change all the permissions of the managers one by one? No, that is too much work, and is pretty bored.

The solution is to use [groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/access-control/active-directory-security-groups#default-security-groups). In this case you could have a "Manager" group where the manager users are added, and when the policy changes you have to add or remove permissions for the group.

As well as users, the groups are stored in the domain database. And, in the same way, they can be identified by the `SamAccountName` attribute or the SID.

You can consult the database in order to list the groups and their members. See the "Enum Groups and Group Members" section of the following resource:

### **Administrative groups**

In Active Directory there are many [default groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/access-control/active-directory-security-groups#default-security-groups) defined for different roles in the domain/forest. As attacker, one of the most juicy groups is the [Domain Admins](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/access-control/active-directory-security-groups#bkmk-domainadmins) group, that gives administrator privileges to its members in the domain, so being aware of who is this group is important.

```powershell
# Domain Admins group information:
PS C:\Users\Anakin> Get-ADGroup "Domain Admins" -Properties members,memberof


DistinguishedName : CN=Domain Admins,CN=Users,DC=contoso,DC=local
GroupCategory     : Security
GroupScope        : Global
MemberOf          : {CN=Denied RODC Password Replication Group,CN=Users,DC=contoso,DC=local,
                    CN=Administrators,CN=Builtin,DC=contoso,DC=local}
Members           : {CN=Administrator,CN=Users,DC=contoso,DC=local}
Name              : Domain Admins
ObjectClass       : group
ObjectGUID        : ac3ac095-3ea0-4922-8130-efa99ba99afa
SamAccountName    : Domain Admins
SID               : S-1-5-21-1372086773-2238746523-2939299801-512
```

But there are also other important groups that can give you a lot of privileges, and ones even more. This is the case of the [Enterprise Admins](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/access-control/active-directory-security-groups#bkmk-entadmins) group, which provides administrator privileges in all the forest.

The `Enterprise Admins` is a group that only exists in the root domain of the forest, but is added by default to the [Administrators](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/access-control/active-directory-security-groups#administrators) group of the all the domains in the forest.

On the other hand, the `Domain Admins` group is added to the `Administrators` group of the domain, as well as the `Administrators` groups of the domain computers.

```shell
# Administrators groups memberships in forest:

## Group Scope <a href="#group-scope" id="group-scope"></a>

In Active Directory there are three different types of groups based on [their scope](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/access-control/active-directory-security-groups#group-scope). To understand them will allow to comprehend how domains and forest can be managed:

* The **Universal groups**, that can have members from the same forests and grant permissions in the same forest or trusted forests. The `Enterprise Admins` group is an example of Universal group.
* The **Global groups**, that can only have members of the same domain, and grants permissions in domains of the same forest or trusting domains or forests. The `Domain Admins` group is an example of Global group.
* Finally, the **DomainLocal groups** can have members from the domain or any trusted domain and grants permissions only in their domains. The `Administrators` group is an example of DomainLocal groups.

Apart from that, you should be also know that **domain groups (and domain users) can be members of computer local groups**. For example, the `Domain Admins` group is added by default to the `Administrators` local group of a machine.
