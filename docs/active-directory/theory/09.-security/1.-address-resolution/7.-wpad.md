# ðŸ““ 7. WPAD

The [WPAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web\_Proxy\_Auto-Discovery\_Protocol) (Web Proxy Auto-Discovery) is a protocol for browsers to get dynamically a file that indicates the proxies they should use. The file indicating the proxies is a [PAC](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/ie11-ieak/proxy-auto-config-examples) (Proxy Auto-Config) javascript file that contains a `FindProxyForURL` function that is invoked by browsers when they navigate to a site.

```python
function FindProxyForURL(url, host) {
    if (host == "example.com") {
        return "PROXY proxy:80";
    }
    return "DIRECT";
}
```

Even if the WPAD protocol is not used by default, it can be found in enterprise environments, since many companies use proxies to watch its traffic. WPAD can be configured in browsers or system settings, or even by [using a GPO](https://tektab.com/2012/09/26/setting-up-web-proxy-autodiscovery-protocol-wpad-using-dns/).

To find the PAC, the browsers usually look for it in `http://wpad.<domain>/wpad.dat`. Another URL can also be set by **DHCP (INSERT LINK TO DHCP)**.

In order to resolve the `wpad.<domain>` the OS send a DNS request. In the past, Windows machines use to send also an LLMNR or NetBIOS request if DNS fails, but since [MS16-077](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security-updates/SecurityBulletins/2016/ms16-077) security update, the broadcast resolution of WPAD is disabled.

Moreover, you cannot create the `wpad` DNS record by using DNS dynamic updates through DNS or DHCP, or directly with LDAP. This is because is protected by the [Global Query Block List](https://www.netspi.com/blog/technical/network-penetration-testing/adidns-revisited/) (GQBL).

So, even if in the past this attack was very popular, today your better chance is to configure a malicious DNS server in the victim, by using DHCP or manually to resolve `wpad` to your host.

```bash
# Configure a fake DNS server from DHCP
$ sudo dhcplayer server -I eth2 -v --domain contoso.local
INFO - IP pool: 192.168.100.1-192.168.100.254
INFO - Mask: 255.255.255.0
INFO - Broadcast: 192.168.100.255
INFO - DHCP: 192.168.100.44
INFO - DNS: [192.168.100.44]

INFO - Requested IP 192.168.100.121
INFO - ACK to 192.168.100.121 for 52:54:00:76:87:bb
```

Additionally, it seems that [in the past it was possible to ask for basic HTTP authentication](https://pentest.blog/what-is-llmnr-wpad-and-how-to-abuse-them-during-pentest/) in the wpad request. However, I tried with different browsers (IE, Edge, Firefox and Chrome) but I was unable to make it work. Only when NTLM was required (using responder.py) the victim browser downloads the wpad file.

```bash
# Serve WPAD file from Responder with NTLM auth
sudo responder -I eth2 -wF                                                                                                                               1 â¨¯

Apart from getting the **NTLM hash to crack (INSERT LINK TO NTLM hashes cracking)**, this could be useful for **NTLM relay (INSERT LINK TO NTLM RELAY)** attacks, since the HTTP doesn't required sign in NTLM and therefore it can be used with any other protocol in NTLM cross-protocol relay attack.

Moreover, to serve the PAC file to the victim will allow you to execute some javascript code as the victim, which could be used to [exfiltrate the visited URLs](https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-16/materials/us-16-Kotler-Crippling-HTTPS-With-Unholy-PAC.pdf).
