# ðŸ““ 4. NetBIOS

## Theory

[NetBIOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetBIOS) (Network Basic Input/Output System) is an OSI Session Layer 5 Protocol (and it is not related with the computer BIOS). It was developed in 1983 to allow applications in the same LAN (Local Area Network) to communicate between them. NetBIOS became very popular and used by many different applications, however, it was not able to communicate them on different networks. Therefore, in 1987, the [NBT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetBIOS\_over\_TCP/IP) (NetBIOS over TCP/IP) protocol was created ([RFC 1001](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1001) and [RFC 1002](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1002)) to make NetBIOS work over TCP and UDP protocols and allow applications that used NetBIOS to communicate over internet.

It is divided in three services, one, the NetBIOS **Name Service**, used for resolving the NetBIOS names, and two services, NetBIOS **Datagram and Session**, for transporting messages (similar to TCP and UDP).

```bash
# NetBIOS ports:
                       .-----
                       |
     .------.        .---
     | NBNS |--UDP-->| 137
     '------'        '---
                       |   
    .-------.        .---
    | NBDGM |--UDP-->| 138
    '-------'        '---
                       |
    .-------.        .---
    | NBSSN |--TCP-->| 139
    '-------'        '---
                       |
                       '-----
```

### **NetBIOS Datagram Service**

The NetBIOS Datagram Service or NetBIOS-DGM or NBDGM is similar to UDP. It is used as transport layer for application protocols that requires a connectionless communication. The server will be listening in the UDP port 138.

### **NetBIOS Session Service**

The NetBIOS Session Service or NetBIOS-SSN or NBSSN is similar to TCP. It can be used as transport for connected-oriented communications. It uses the 139/TCP port.

### **NetBIOS Name Service**

From a pentest perspective, maybe the most interesting NetBIOS service is NBNS (NetBIOS Name Service) that listens in the port 137/UDP. This service allows to:

* Resolve NetBIOS name to an IP address
* Known the status of a NetBIOS node
* Register/Release a NetBIOS name

The NetBIOS names, in contrast with the DNS names, are not hierarchical, and only work in the local network. These names are made up of 16 bytes, where the first 15 bytes are used to store the name, in uppercase letters, and last byte indicates the type of the resource that has the name, which can be a hostname, domain name, a file service, etc. To watch the NetBIOS names of the local Windows machine, you can use the `nbtstat -n` command.

```bash
# NetBIOS names of local computer:
C:\Users\test>nbtstat -n

Ethernet 2:
Node IpAddress: [192.168.100.10] Scope Id: []

                NetBIOS Local Name Table

       Name               Type         Status
    ---------------------------------------------
    WS01-10        <20>  UNIQUE      Registered
    WS01-10        <00>  UNIQUE      Registered
    CONTOSO        <00>  GROUP       Registered
```

As we can see, several names of different types are shown. In order to identify them you can use the following table that contains the most common names, but [there are many more](https://web.archive.org/web/20031010135027/http://www.neohapsis.com:80/resources/wins.htm#sec2).

### NetBIOS name types

| Number | Type   | Usage           |
| ------ | ------ | --------------- |
| 00     | UNIQUE | Hostname        |
| 00     | GROUP  | Domain name     |
| 01     | GROUP  | Master Browser  |
| 1D     | UNIQUE | Master Browser  |
| 1E     | GROUP  | Browser service |
| 20     | UNIQUE | File server     |

The NBNS protocol was implemented by Microsoft as [WINS](https://web.archive.org/web/20031010135027/http://www.neohapsis.com:80/resources/wins.htm#sec4sub4sub4) (Windows Internet Name Service). In a network, each Windows computer has a WINS database that stores the available network resources, as well as its netbios and domain (or workgroup) name. Moreover, a WINS server can also be setup, that works like a DNS server with NetBIOS names.

Therefore, in order to resolve a NetBIOS name there are two available strategies. The first one is to query to the WINS server to resolve the name. If this is not possible, then the query can be sent to the IP broadcast address, waiting for the answer from the target computer. A NBNS name resolution is performed when a NetBIOS name is used to connect to another machine, for example, in a command such as `net view \\name`. In Linux machines is possible to use the [nmblookup](https://www.samba.org/samba/docs/current/man-html/nmblookup.1.html) utility to resolve NetBIOS names.

```shell
# nmblookup resolution
nmblookup ws01-10
192.168.100.10 ws01-10<00>
```

It must be noted that, in case of a broadcast request, any computer can respond to the query, so it allows to an attacker to impersonate the real computer. This is one of the tactics followed by [responder.py](https://github.com/lgandx/Responder) and [Inveigh](https://github.com/Kevin-Robertson/Inveigh) to collect NTLM hashes.

Also, it must taked into account that NBNS is not used if any other protocol can resolve the name request. The order of preference is the following:

1. DNS
2. mDNS
3. LLMNR
4. NBNS

Additionally, in case of knowing the IP of a NetBIOS node, you can ask it about its services. In a Windows machine this can be done with the [nbtstat](https://docs.microsoft.com/es-es/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/nbtstat) command.

```bash
# Resolving hostname and services with ntbstat
C:\Users\Anakin>nbtstat -A 192.168.100.4

Ethernet 2:
Node IpAddress: [192.168.100.3] Scope Id: []

           NetBIOS Remote Machine Name Table

       Name               Type         Status
    ---------------------------------------------
    WS02-7         <00>  UNIQUE      Registered
    CONTOSO        <00>  GROUP       Registered
    WS02-7         <20>  UNIQUE      Registered
    CONTOSO        <1E>  GROUP       Registered
    CONTOSO        <1D>  UNIQUE      Registered
    â˜ºâ˜»__MSBROWSE__â˜»<01>  GROUP       Registered

    MAC Address = 52-54-00-A4-8C-F2
```

In the nbstat output you can see the hostname, the domain (or workgroup) name, and several services of the machine, specified by the type. You can check the meaning of type column in [this table](https://web.archive.org/web/20031010135027/http://www.neohapsis.com:80/resources/wins.htm#sec2).

Furthermore, it is possible to use this capability to perform a NetBIOS scan in a network and discover machines and services. This can be accomplished with [nbtscan](http://www.unixwiz.net/tools/nbtscan.html) or nmap script [nbtstat.nse](https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/nbstat.html), from both Windows or Linux.

```bash
# NetBIOS scan with nbtscan
root@debian10:~$ nbtscan 192.168.100.0/24
192.168.100.2   CONTOSO\DC01                    SHARING DC
192.168.100.7   CONTOSO\WS02-7                  SHARING
*timeout (normal end of scan)
```

{% hint style="info" %}
In case you are connected to the network through proxychains, this won't work since proxychains doesn't redirect UDP connections.
{% endhint %}

Moreover, NBNS also allows to NetBIOS nodes to register and release their names. When a node is connected to the network, it sends a registration message to the WINS server, or if this not possible, a broadcast message. Also, when the node leave the network it should send a message to release the name, what doesn't usually happen.

It should be note that NBNS/WINS is considered a legacy protocol so its use [is discouraged](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/networking/technologies/wins/wins-top). However, it can be still found working in many Windows networks, since it is enabled by default for compatibility reasons.
