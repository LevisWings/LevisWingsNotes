# ðŸ““ 2. SPNEGO

SPNEGO (Simple and Protected GSS-API Negotiation) is a mechanism that allows to client-server applications to negotiatite the underlying security protocol, that is GSS-API compatible, used by the application. This way, both client (also known as initiator in [RFC 4178](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4178)) and server (known as acceptor), can establish the same GSS context (by calling GSS\_Init\_sec\_context).

The process for SPNEGO is basically the following:

1. The client (initiator) calls to _GSS\_Init\_sec\_context_ and indicates that SPNEGO is going to be used. Then a list with options of security mechanism is returned (mechTypes) and optionally an initial token for the preferred mechanism (mechToken). This information is sent to the server (acceptor) in the message _NegTokenInit_.

2\. The server application passes the initial token and list of security mechanisms to _GSS\_Accept\_sec\_context_. Then one of the following results is returned and sent in a _NegTokenResp_ message (_NegTokenResp_ is the same that _NegTokenTarg_ shown by Wireshark):

1. None of the security mechanisms is accepted. The server rejects the negotiation.
2. If the selected security mechanism is the preferred by the client, the received token is used. A negotiation token containing an _accept-complete_ state is created.
3. Other mechanism than the preferred mechanism is selected, therefore a negotiation token with _accept-incompleted_ or _request-mic_ state is created.

3\. If the negotiation is returned to the client, then this passes it to _GSS\_Init\_sec\_context_ and analyzes it. The negotiation continues until both client and server agree in a security mechanism and options.

Windows uses SPNEGO through the [Negotiate SSP](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthn/microsoft-negotiate). This allows services like SMB to use Kerberos or NTLM authentication. Kerberos is mainly used to authenticate domain users whereas NTLM allows to authenticate local computer users. Usually, there is a third option called [NEGOEX](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows\_protocols/ms-negoex), that allows to amplify the SPNEGO options, but I never seem this option being used.

Actually, Windows uses an extension for SPNEGO, [SPNG](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows\_protocols/ms-spng/f377a379-c24f-4a0f-a3eb-0d835389e28a). This extension includes improvements to SPNEGO, like a new message called _NegTokenInit2_ that allows the server to init the SPNEGO negotiation.
