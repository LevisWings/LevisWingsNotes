# ðŸ““ 01. Domains

A **domain** is a **set of connected computers** that shares an **** Active Directory database, which is managed by the central servers of a domain, that are called **Domain Controllers.**

## Domain name

Each domain has a DNS name. In many companies, the name of the domain is the same as their web site, for example `contoso.com`, while others have a different internal domain such as `contoso.local`. See the "**Identify current user/computer domain**" section of the following resource:

{% endcontent-ref %}

In addition to its **DNS name**, every domain can also be identified with NetBIOS name. For example, the domain `contoso.local` could have the **NetBIOS name** `CONTOSO`. You can see the NetBIOS name being used in log in operations, where the user is identified with something like `CONTOSO\Administrator`, where the first part is the **NetBIOS name** and the second one is the **username**.

Finally, a domain can be identified by its **SID** (Security Identifier). The SID is more used by programs (using the Windows API) than users, but you should know how to obtain it in case you require it. See the "**Get Domain SID**" section of the following resource:
