# ðŸŽ« Pass-The-Ticket (PTT)

There are multiple ways to obtain a ticket for use in Kerberos authentication:

* Use password
* Overpass-the-Hash
* Pass-The-Key
* Harvest tickets from Windows/Linux

The methodology to perform a successful Pass-The-Ticket consists of 3 stages, covering all aspects from getting a ticket to using/injecting them and then remotely executing commands on a remote system. All these ways are documented in the following sections:
