# 139,445 - SMB

## Introduction

While port 139 is technically known as 'NBT over IP', port 445 is 'SMB over IP'. **SMB** stands for '**Server Message Block**'. In modern parlance, Server Message Block is also known as **Common Internet File System**. The system functions as an application-layer network protocol that is primarily used to provide shared access to files, printers, serial ports and other types of communications between nodes on a network.

For example, in Windows, SMB can run directly over TCP/IP without the need for NetBIOS over TCP/IP. This will use, as you point out, port 445. On other systems, you will find services and applications that use port 139. This means that SMB runs with NetBIOS over TCP/IP.
