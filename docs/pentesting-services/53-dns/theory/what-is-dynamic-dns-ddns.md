# What is Dynamic DNS (DDNS)?

Many web properties, such as APIs or websites, run on Internet connections whose IP addresses change frequently; this creates a problem if the operators of those properties want to give a hosted resource a specific domain name, which must store an IP address in the Domain Name System (DNS) records. Dynamic DNS (DDNS) is a service that keeps the DNS updated with the correct IP address of a web property, even if that IP address is constantly being updated.

For example, if a web administrator manages a small site with the domain name [www.example.com](http://www.example.com) and an IP address of 192.0.2.0, every time another user enters [www.example.com](http://www.example.com) in their browser, the DNS will direct them to the 192.0.2.0 server. If the administrator's ISP dynamically changes the IP to 192.0.2.1, a dynamic DNS service can automatically update the administrator's DNS records so that other users trying to visit [www.example.com](http://www.example.com) will now go to the correct IP address.

### Why do some IP addresses change?

In the early days of the Internet, IP addresses rarely changed, which greatly simplified domain management. But the rapid growth of the web and home computers with Internet access created a shortage of available IP addresses. This gave rise to the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), which allows ISPs to assign IPs to their users dynamically. ISPs typically maintain a shared pool of IP addresses and assign or "rent" them to users as needed, for the duration of their connection or until a maximum time is reached. Although the introduction of IPV6 alleviated the shortage of IP addresses, ISPs still often use DHCP because it is more cost-effective than providing static IPs.

Large companies running major web services require their ISPs to provide immutable or "static" IP addresses in order to operate with standard DNS practices. In contrast, smaller services tend to see their IP addresses changed by their ISPs quite frequently, requiring a dynamic DNS solution to keep their DNS records up to date. These smaller services may include small business websites, personal websites, DVRs and security cameras.
