# 53 - DNS

The **Domain Name System** (DNS) is the telephone directory of the Internet. Humans access online information through domain names, such as nytimes.com or espn.com. Web browsers interact through Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. The DNS translates domain names into [IP addresses](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/glossary/what-is-my-ip-address/) so that browsers can load Internet resources.
