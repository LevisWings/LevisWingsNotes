# Dump DNS records

Furthermore, even if zone transfers are not allowed, due to DNS records are stored in the Active Directory database, they can be read by using LDAP. Thus, any domain user can use the LDAP protocol to dump all the DNS records. For this purpose, the [adidnsdump](https://github.com/dirkjanm/adidnsdump) tool can be used (saves the results in `records.csv`) or the [dns-dump.ps1](https://github.com/mmessano/PowerShell/blob/master/dns-dump.ps1) script.
