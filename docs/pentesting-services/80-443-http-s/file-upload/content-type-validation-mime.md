# Content Type Validation (MIME)

Content type validation is when the server validates the content of the file by checking the MIME type of the file, which can be displayed in the http request. For example, some image file uploads validate uploaded images by checking if the content type of the file is an image type.

MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension) types are used as identifiers for files - originally when they are transferred as email attachments, but now also when files are transferred over HTTP(S). The MIME type for a file upload is attached in the request header, and looks as follows:

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/content\_type.png)

MIME types follow the / format. In the above request, you can see that the image "spaniel.jpg" was uploaded to the server. As a legitimate JPEG image, the MIME type for this upload was "image/jpeg". The MIME type of a file can be checked client-side and/or server-side; however, since the MIME is based on the file extension, this is extremely easy to bypass.

### Content Type Bypass

This type of validation can be bypassed by renaming the file to, for example, "shell.php" or "shell.aspx" but keeping the "Content-Type" parameter as "image/Content-Type". Examples:

* image/png
* image/jpeg
* image/gif
