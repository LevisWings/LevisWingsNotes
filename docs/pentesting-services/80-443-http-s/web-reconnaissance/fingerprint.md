## Identify technologies

The stage of identifying the technologies of a web application is fundamental because in some cases we can quickly find an attack vector.

Some of the tools that can identify technologies include frameworks (Laravel, React), web server (Nginx, Apache, IIS), programming language (PHP, ASP.NET), CMS, etc.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="whatweb" %}
```bash
whatweb <URL>
whatweb -a 3 -v <URL>
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Wappanalyzer " %}
{% embed url="https://www.wappalyzer.com" %}
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="nmap" %}
```bash
nmap --script "vuln and safe" -p 80,443 <URL> -oN webScan
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="BuiltWith" %}
[BuiltWith](https://builtwith.com) technology tracking includes widgets, analytics, frameworks, content management systems, advertisers, content delivery networks, web standards and web servers to name some of the technology categories we cover.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="archive.org" %}
[Archive.org](https://archive.org) is a site to consult the "history" of a web page, how it was before and how it is now, etc. Sometimes, in the history we can find information about technologies, versions, or some idea of the backend.

## Analyze certificate

View certificate information with openssl:

```bash
openssl s_client -connect <IP/DOMAIN>:443
```

## Initial checks

### Default pages with interesting info

```
robots.txt
sitemap.xml
crossdomain.xml
clientaccesspolicy.xml
.well-known/
.well-known/security.txt
```

Also, we can search the source code for some interesting tags:

```
href,http,user,pass,hidden,<SUBDOMAIN>
```

{% hint style="danger" %}
Check also comments in the main and secondary pages. (`<!--`, `#`)
{% endhint %}

### Forcing errors

Web servers may **behave unexpectedly** when weird data is sent to them. This may open **vulnerabilities** or **disclosure sensitive information**.

* Access **fake pages** like /whatever\_fake.php (.aspx,.html,.etc).
* **Add "\[]", "]]", and "\[\["** in **cookie values** and **parameter** values to create errors.
* Generate error by giving input as `/~randomthing/%s` at the **end** of **URL**
* Try **different HTTP Verbs** like PATCH, OPTIONS, DEBUG or wrong like FAKE.

## SSL/TLS vulnerabilites

Identify SSL certificate features or SSL-based vulnerabilities (Heartbleed) in SSL-enabled services:

```bash
# sslscan
sslscan <IP/DOMAIN>
# testssl.sh
git clone https://github.com/drwetter/testssl.sh
./testssl.sh https://<IP/DOMAIN>
```

## favicon.ico

Sometimes, we can identify a technology (such as the web server or framework) with the **favicon.ico** file, which almost all web applications have. Example of a favicon from Wikipedia:

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/favicon\_wikipedia.ico)

We can also get the MD5 hash of that icon and Google it to see the exact technology. This technique only works with popular favicons.

```bash
curl <URL>/favicon.ico | md5sum
```
