# Web Application Firewall (WAF)

## Theory

A web application firewall (WAF) helps protect web applications by filtering and monitoring HTTP traffic between a web application and the Internet. Typically, it protects web applications from attacks such as XSS, LFI, SQLi, etc. Therefore, if we can identify whether the web application uses a WAF, and know what type it is, it can help us bypass known filters.

## Practice

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="wafw00f" %}
[wafw00f](https://github.com/EnableSecurity/wafw00f) allows one to identify and fingerprint Web Application Firewall (WAF) products protecting a website:

```bash
wafw00f <URL>
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="nmap" %}
These 2 scripts attempt to detect the presence of a web application firewall:

```bash
nmap -p <PORT> --script=http-waf-fingerprint,http-waf-detect <URL>
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
