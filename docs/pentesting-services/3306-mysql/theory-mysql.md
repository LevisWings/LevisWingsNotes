# Theory (MySQL)

In its simplest definition, MySQL is a relational database management system (RDBMS) based on structured query language (SQL). The definition of these acronyms would be as follows:

* **Database**: A persistent, organized collection of structured data.
* **RDBMS:** A database management system (DBMS) that incorporates the relational-data model (R), normally including a Structured Query Language (SQL) application programming interface. It is a DBMS in which the database is organized and accessed according to the relationships between data items. In a relational database, relationships between data items are expressed by means of tables. Interdependencies among these tables are expressed by data values rather than by pointers. This allows a high degree of data independence.

### How does MySQL work?

MySQL, as an RDBMS, is composed of the server and the utility programs that assist in the administration of MySQL databases.

The server handles all database instructions such as creating, editing and accessing data. It takes and manages these requests and communicates using the MySQL protocol. This whole process can be divided into these stages:

* MySQL creates a database to store and manipulate data, defining the relationship of each table.
* Clients make requests by making specific SQL statements.
* The server will respond to the client with the requested information.
