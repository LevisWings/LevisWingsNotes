## Firewall

A firewall is a system whose function is to prevent and protect our private network from intrusions or attacks from other networks, blocking access. That is to say, if the traffic complies with the previously specified rules, it will be able to access and leave our network; if it does not comply, this traffic is blocked.

## Subnetting

![Subnetting (Cheat Sheet)](../.gitbook/assets/subnetting\_cheatsheet.png)

```bash
# Subnets to create:
2^n >= <SUBNETS TO CREATE>
# Number of hosts per subnet:
2^(32 - <CIDR>) -2 = HOSTS
# Valid hosts (without network address and broadcast):
<HOSTS> - 2 = VALID HOSTS
# "Network jump":
256 - <SUBNET MASK OCTECT>
```

Split the network **10.200.20.0/27** into **4 subnets** and submit the network address of the 2nd subnet as the answer.

```bash
# Subnets to create:
2^2 >= 4
/27 + 2 = /29
10.200.20.0/29
255.255.255.248

# Number of hosts per subnet:
2^(32 - 29) -2 = 6

# Valid hosts (without network address and broadcast):
6 - 2 = 4

# "Network jump":
256 - 248 = 8

10.200.20.0/29
10.200.20.8/29
10.200.20.16/29
10.200.20.24/29
```
